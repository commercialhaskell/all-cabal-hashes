description:  Features:

              .

              - Reload individual components of your application as
                you iterate: improves development experience for
                long-running applications such as (web) servers or
                user interfaces by keeping the app running in the
                background and allowes reloading components after code
                changes.

              .

              - Reuse expensive resources across reloads: useful in
                batch-style programs to compute/aquire a resource
                once, then reuse it across code reloads.

              .

              Technically, this package is a safe and convenient wrapper around
              <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/foreign-store foreign-store>.
