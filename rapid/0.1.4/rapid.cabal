description:  This package provides a rapid prototyping suite for GHCi
    that can be used standalone or integrated into editors.  You can
    hot-reload individual running components as you make changes to
    their code.  It is designed to shorten the development cycle during
    the development of long-running programs like servers, web
    applications and interactive user interfaces.
    .
    It can also be used in the context of batch-style programs:  Keep
    resources that are expensive to create in memory and reuse them
    across module reloads instead of reloading/recomputing them after
    every code change.
    .
    Technically this package is a safe and convenient wrapper around
    <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/foreign-store foreign-store>.
