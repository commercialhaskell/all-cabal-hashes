synopsis:      An implementation of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm
description:
  The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is an iterative technique that
  finds a local minimum of a function that is expressed as the sum of
  squares of nonlinear functions. It has become a standard technique
  for nonlinear least-squares problems and can be thought of as a
  combination of steepest descent and the Gauss-Newton method. When
  the current solution is far from the correct one, the algorithm
  behaves like a steepest descent method: slow, but guaranteed to
  converge. When the current solution is close to the correct
  solution, it becomes a Gauss-Newton method.
  .
  Optional box- and linear constraints can be given. Both single and
  double precision floating point types are supported.
  .
  The actual algorithm is implemented in a C library which is bundled
  with @bindings-levmar@ which this package depends on. See:
  <http://www.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/levmar/>.
