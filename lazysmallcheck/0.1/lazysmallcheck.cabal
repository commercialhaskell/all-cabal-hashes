Synopsis:           A library for demand-driven testing of Haskell programs
Description:
    Lazy SmallCheck is a library for exhaustive, demand-driven testing of
    Haskell programs.  It is based on the idea that if a property holds
    for a partially-defined input then it must also hold for all
    fully-defined instantiations of the that input.  Compared to ``eager''
    input generation as in SmallCheck, Lazy SmallCheck may require
    significantly fewer test-cases to verify a property for all inputs up
    to a given depth.
