description:
    Amazon CodeDeploy is a service that automates code deployments to
    Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to
    rapidly release new features, helps you avoid downtime during
    deployment, and handles the complexity of updating your applications.
    You can use Amazon CodeDeploy to automate deployments, eliminating the
    need for error-prone manual operations, and the service scales with
    your infrastructure so you can easily deploy to one EC2 instance or
    thousands.
