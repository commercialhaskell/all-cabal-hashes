Name:         storable-record
Version:      0.0.1
Category:     Data, Foreign
Synopsis:     Elegant definition of Storable instances for records
Description:
  With this package definition
  you can build a Storable instance of a record type
  from Storable instances of its elements.
  This is as simple as:
  .
  > import Foreign.Storable.Record as Store
  > import Foreign.Storable (Storable (..), )
  >
  > import Control.Applicative (liftA2, )
  >
  > data Stereo a = Stereo (left, right :: a)
  > -- parentheses must be curly braces, but Haddock does not like them
  >
  > store :: Storable a => Store.Dictionary (Stereo a)
  > store =
  >    Store.run $
  >    liftA2 Stereo
  >       (Store.element left)
  >       (Store.element right)
  >
  > instance (Storable a) => Storable (Stereo a) where
  >    sizeOf = Store.sizeOf store
  >    alignment = Store.alignment store
  >    peek = Store.peek store
  >    poke = Store.poke store
  .
  I cannot promise that the generated memory layout
  is compatible with that of a corresponding C struct.
  However, the module generates the smallest layout
  that is possible with respect to the alignment of the record elements.
  Thus this package might provide a Haskell98 alternative to HSC
  without a preprocessor.
  If you encounter, that a record does not have a compatible layout,
  we should fix that.
  But also without C compatibility this package is useful
  e.g. in connection with StorableVector.
  .
  The @Stereo@ constructor is exclusively used
  for constructing the @peek@ function,
  where as the accessors in the @element@ calls
  are used for assembling the @poke@ function.
  It is required that the order of arguments of @Stereo@
  matches the record accessors in the @element@ calls.
  If you want that the stored data correctly and fully represents
  your Haskell data, it must hold:
  .
  >   Stereo (left x) (right x) = x   .
  .
  Unfortunately this cannot be checked automatically.
  However, mismatching types that are caused by swapped arguments
  are detected by the type system.
  Our system performs for you:
  Size and alignment computation, poking and peeking.
  Thus several inconsistency bugs can be prevented using this package,
  like size mismatches space required by @poke@ actions.
  There is no more restriction,
  thus smart constructors and accessors
  and nested records work, too.
  For nested records however,
  I recommend individual Storable instances for the sub-records.
  .
  You see it would simplify class instantiation
  if we could tell the class dictionary at once
  instead of defining each method separately.
