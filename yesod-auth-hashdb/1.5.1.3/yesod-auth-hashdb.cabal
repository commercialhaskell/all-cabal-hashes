description:
    This package is the Yesod.Auth.HashDB plugin, originally included as part
    of yesod-auth, but now modified to be more secure and placed in a separate
    package.
    .
    It provides authentication using hashed passwords stored in a database,
    and works best in situations where an administrator is involved in
    setting up a user with an initial password.
    .
    The complete login process, including a default form, is implemented by
    this plugin, but the application developer must design the interfaces
    for setting up users and allowing them to change their own passwords,
    since only the low-level password-setting functions are provided by this
    package.  (Note that other authentication plugins may be more appropriate
    if you wish to use email verification to set up accounts).
