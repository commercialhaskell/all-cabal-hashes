description:        This package provides first class functional references.
                    In addition to the usual operations of getting, setting and composition, plus integration with monad state, lens families provide some unique features:
                    .
                    * Polymorphic updating
                    .
                    * Traversals
                    .
                    * Cast projection functions to read-only lenses
                    .
                    * Cast \"toList\" functions to read-only traversals
                    .
                    * Cast semantic editor combinators to modify-only traversals.
