Description:
   Edison is a library of purely functional data structures written by
   Chris Okasaki.  It is named after Thomas Alva Edison and for the
   mnemonic value EDiSon (Efficent Data Structures).
   Edison provides several families of abstractions, each with
   multiple implementations.  The main abstractions provided by Edison are:
   Sequences such as stacks, queues, and dequeues;
   Collections such as sets, bags and heaps; and
   Associative Collections such as finite maps and priority queues
   where the priority and element are distinct.
