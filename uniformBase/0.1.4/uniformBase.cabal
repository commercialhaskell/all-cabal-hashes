name:           uniformBase
version:        0.1.4
synopsis:       A uniform base to build apps on
description:    Goals:
                .
                  - reducing the complexity for the programmer of applications, 
                .
                  - functions with identical semantics independent of representation,
                .
                  - all functions are total (or become so using Maybe or Either),
                .
                  - compatible error reporting for all packages,
                .
                  - avoid name clashes with other packages and assume the regular prelude,
                .
                  - performance is NOT a goal - once the program logic is confirmed and tested, performance improvements can be achieved based on observations     
                .
                The packages included here deal with 
                .
                  - a generally usable zero (null) value and other simplistic 
                  algebras,
                .
                  - handling of text independent of represenations and principled conversion between representations,
                .
                  - a minimal error reporting as text error messages,
                .
                  - bringing together functions to handle time,
                .
                  - uniform functions to handle files and filepaths (`Filepath` and `Path`).
                .
