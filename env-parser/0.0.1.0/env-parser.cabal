synopsis:            Pull configuration information from the ENV
description:         
  @env-parser@ is a small library for configuring programs based on information
  from the environment.
  .
  Command-line oriented programs tend to pull much of their runtime
  configuration from command-line arguments and libraries such as @cmdargs@ are
  useful for encoding this configuration in your program. For programs which
  draw configuration from the environment, however, this must usually be done
  manually.
  .
  @env-parser@ focuses on making ENV-configured programs both easy to build,
  declarative, self-documenting, and easy to test.
  .
  A particular use case of this parser is to make it easy to build applications
  which launch under Heroku-style infrastructure. We provide explicit parsers
  for some of Heroku's conventions for this purpose.
