name:           versions
version:        3.5.1
synopsis:       Types and parsers for software version numbers.
description:    A library for parsing and comparing software version numbers. We like to give version numbers to our software in a myriad of ways. Some ways follow strict guidelines for incrementing and comparison. Some follow conventional wisdom and are generally self-consistent. Some are just plain asinine. This library provides a means of parsing and comparing /any/ style of versioning, be it a nice Semantic Version like this:
                .
                > 1.2.3-r1+git123
                .
                ...or a monstrosity like this:
                .
                > 2:10.2+0.0093r3+1-1
                .
                Please switch to <http://semver.org Semantic Versioning> if you aren't currently using it. It provides consistency in version incrementing and has the best constraints on comparisons.
