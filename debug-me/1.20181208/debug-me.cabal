Synopsis: secure remote debugging
Description:
 Debugging a problem over email/irc/BTS is slow, tedious, and hard. The developer
 needs to see your problem to understand it. Debug-me aims to make debugging
 fast, fun, and easy, by letting the developer access your computer remotely,
 so they can immediately see and interact with the problem. Making your
 problem their problem gets it fixed fast.
 .
 A debug-me session is logged and signed with the developer's GnuPG
 key, producing a chain of evidence of what they saw and what they did.
 So the developer's good reputation is leveraged to make debug-me secure.
 If you trust a developer to ship software to your computer,
 you can trust them to debug-me.
 .
 When you start debug-me without any options, it will connect to a debug-me
 server, and print out an url that you can give to the developer to get
 them connected to you. Then debug-me will show you their GnuPG key and who
 has signed it, and will let you know if they are a known developer
 of software on your computer. If the developer has a good reputation,
 you can proceed to let them type into your console in a debug-me session.
 Once the session is done, the debug-me server will email you the signed
 evidence of what the developer did in the session.
 . 
 If the developer did do something bad, you'd have proof that they cannot
 be trusted, which you can share with the world. Knowing that is the case
 will keep most developers honest.
