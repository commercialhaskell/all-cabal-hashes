synopsis:
    Write stream processing computations with side effects in a series of
    tubes.

-- A longer description of the package.
description:
    This package provides the @Tube@ monad transformer, allowing any monad
    computation to become a stream processing pipeline. A computation of type
    @Tube a b m r@ consumes values of type 'a' and produces values of type
    'b'.
    .
    Specialized @Tube@s exist which allow for stream branching, merging, and
    other non-linear control. These are @Source@, @Sink@, and @Channel@.
    .
    Also provided are @Pump@s, the comonadic dual to @Tube@s. Examples are
    provided of how they can be used with @Tube@s but we have almost certainly
    only scratched the surface.
    .
    Examples and more information may be found at
    <https://github.com/gatlin/tubes>.
    .
    I seem to have trouble uploading packages where the documentation can be
    built correctly on Hackage. If I have (once again) messed this up, you can
    find Haddock documentation at <https://niltag.net/tubes>. I apologize for
    any inconvenience!
    .
    This should compile on GHC 7.8, but the problem
    is that previous attempts at setting the versions properly rendered Hackage
    unable to generate documentation. Hopefully I have this fixed but any
    advice is welcome.
