Synopsis: Atomic compare and swap for IORefs and STRefs.

Description:

  After GHC 7.2 a new `casMutVar#` primop became available, but was
  not yet exposed in Data.IORef.  This package fills that gap until
  such a time as Data.IORef obsoletes it.
 .
  Further, in addition to exposing native Haskell CAS operations, this
  package contains \"mockups\" that imititate the same functionality
  using either atomicModifyIORef and unsafe pointer equality (in
  @Data.CAS.Fake@) or using foreign functions (@Data.CAS.Foreign@).
  These alternatives are useful for debugging.
  .
  Note that the foreign option does not operate on IORefs and so is
  directly interchangeable with `Data.CAS` and `Data.CAS.Fake` only if
  the interface in `Data.CAS.Class` is used.
