Synopsis:           An IDL compiler for Haskell
Description:
    HaskellDirect is an IDL compiler for Haskell, which offers a helping
    hand to the Haskell programmer that wants to better interact with
    and reuse external code.
 . 
    Interfacing Haskell code to external code involves the conversion of
    values between the Haskell world and the outside, as data
    representations and details of how memory is managed, are worlds
    apart at times. Manually writing the boilerplate code that takes
    care of this conversion is about as exciting as watching grass grow
    and, as a result, error prone.
 .
    Using an Interface Definition Language (IDL) as basis, HaskellDirect
    automates the generation of such impedance matching code, generating
    all the necessary marshaling code for you.
 . 
    With IDL, the functionality provided by a programming interface is
    specified in a programming language neutral framework. The
    HaskellDirect IDL compiler converts this specification into a set of
    method stubs. Depending on how the compiler is invoked, these stubs
    can be used to:
 .
 * Call upon external functions from within Haskell, HaskellDirect creates bindings to external (C-callable) libraries.
 . 
 * Let external code call upon Haskell functions, HaskellDirect creates foreign/external language interfaces to Haskell libraries.
 .
 * Call COM (Microsoft's Component Object Model) methods from Haskell, HaskellDirect helps you use Microsoft COM components from within Haskell.  The generated stubs can be used with Hugs98 or GHC.
 .
 * Create COM method wrappers, HaskellDirect packages up Haskell code as COM components.
 .
    The HaskellDirect IDL compiler currently groks both the OSF DCE
    dialect of IDL (including the various extensions introduced by the
    Microsoft IDL compiler) and the OMG IIOP/CORBA dialect. (Only the
    former can be used for describing COM interfaces.)
