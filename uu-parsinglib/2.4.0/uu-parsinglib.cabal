Synopsis:            Online, error-correcting parser combinators; monadic and applicative interfaces       
Cabal-Version:       >=1.4
Description:         New version of the Utrecht University parser combinator library, which  provides online, error correction, 
                     annotation free, applicative style parser combinators. In addition to this we even  provide a monadic interface.
                     Parsers do analyse themselves to avoid commonly made errors
                     .
                     The file Text.ParserCombinators.UU.Examples contains a ready-made main function,
                     which can be called to see the error correction at work. It contains extensive haddock documentation; 
                     try all the small tests for yourself to see the correction process at work, and to get a 
                     feeling for how to use the various combinators.
                     .
                     The file CHANGELOG which is distributed with the pacakge describes the list of changes and additions
                     .
                     The file README contains some references to background information
                     .
