-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            Tool for presenting PDF-based presentations.

-- A longer description of the package.
Description:         The Haskell Pdf Presenter ("hpdfp") is a tool for presenting PDF-based
                     slide shows.  It has many features and niceties that make delivering
                     a presentation easier.  For example, as a
                     presenter, it is useful to see the next slide before it is shown to
                     the audience as well as how much allotted time remains.
                     .
                     There are a lot of features that may not be immediately obvious so
                     please be sure to look at the documentation.
                     For help with the command line, use the "--help" flag.
                     For help with the GUI, press the "?" key when the program is running.
                     The "README" contains a terse summary of all the features.
                     .
