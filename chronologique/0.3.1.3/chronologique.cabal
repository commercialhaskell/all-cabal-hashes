name:                chronologique
version:             0.3.1.3
synopsis:            Time to manipulate time
description:
 A simple type useful for representing timestamps as generated by system
 events, along with conveniences for converting between time types from common
 Haskell time libraries.
 .
 Our original use was wanting to conveniently measure things happening on
 distributed computer systems. Since machine clock cycles are in units of
 nanoseconds, this has the nice property that, assuming the system clock is not
 corrupted, two subsequent events from the same source process are likely to
 have monotonically increasing timestamps. And even if the system clock has
 skew, they're still decently likely to be unique per device. These TimeStamps
 thus make good keys when building Maps.
 .
 The core type is in "Chrono.TimeStamp", see there for full documentation.
