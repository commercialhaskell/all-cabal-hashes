synopsis:            Recommendations using alternating least squares algorithm
description:
    This package provides a recommendation algorithm based on alternating
    least squares algorithm, as made famous by the Netflix Prize.
    .
    It takes as its input a list of user-item pairs and returns a list of
    recommendations for each user.  The current implementation is limited
    to using unrated pairs.
    .
    The algorithm is parallelized and should be quick enough to train the
    model within seconds for a few thousand users and items.  Getting
    recommendations from a computed model happens nearly instantly.
    .
    For implementation details, see "Large-scale Parallel Collaborative
    Filtering for the Netflix Prize" by Yunhong Zhou, Dennis Wilkinson,
    Robert Schreiber and Rong Pan.
