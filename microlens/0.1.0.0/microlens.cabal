version:             0.1.0.0
x-revision: 1
synopsis:            A tiny part of the ‘lens’ library which you can depend upon.
description:
  This is an extract from the @lens@ library (with only 1 dependency).
  It's not a toy lenses library, unsuitable for “real world”, but merely
  a small one. It is compatible with @lens@, and should have same
  performance.
  .
  Use this library:
  .
    * if you want to define lenses or traversals in your own library, but
      don't want to depend on @lens@
    * if you are new to lenses and want a small library to play with,
      but don't want to use something “inferior” or have to relearn things
      when/if you switch to @lens@
  .
  Don't use this library:
  .
    * if you need @Iso@s, @Prism@s, indexed traversals, @at@, @ix@,
      or actually anything else which isn't defined here
    * if you think lenses compose “in the wrong order” (in which case
      you're looking for @fclabels@)
  .
  Note that microlens has /no/ dependencies starting from GHC 7.10 
  (base-4.8). Prior to that, it has to depend on transformers-0.2 or above.
