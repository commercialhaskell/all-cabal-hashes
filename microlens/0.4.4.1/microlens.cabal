synopsis:            A tiny lens library with no dependencies. If you're writing an app, you probably want microlens-platform, not this.
description:
  This is an extract from <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> (with no dependencies). It's not a toy lenses library, unsuitable for “real world”, but merely a small one. It is compatible with lens, and should have same performance. It also has better documentation.
  .
  Use this library:
  .
    * if you want to define lenses or traversals in your own library, but don't want to depend on lens
  .
    * if you are new to lenses and want a small library to play with, but don't want to use something “inferior” or have to relearn things when/if you switch to lens
  .
  Don't use this library:
  .
    * if you need @Iso@s, @Prism@s, indexed traversals, or actually anything else which isn't defined here (tho some indexed functions are available elsewhere – containers and vector provide them for their types, and <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ilist ilist> provides indexed functions for lists)
  .
    * if you want a library with a clean, understandable implementation (in which case you're looking for <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-simple lens-simple>)
  .
  If you're writing an application which uses lenses more extensively, look at <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-platform microlens-platform> – it combines features of most other microlens packages (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-mtl microlens-mtl>, <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-th microlens-th>, <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-ghc microlens-ghc>).
  .
  If you want to export getters or folds and don't mind the <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/contravariant contravariant> dependency, please consider using <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens-contra microlens-contra>.
  .
  There's a longer readme <https://github.com/aelve/microlens#readme on Github>, you should read it if you're interested about using this library.
  .
  If you haven't ever used lenses before, read <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-tutorial/docs/Control-Lens-Tutorial.html this tutorial>. (It's for lens, but it applies to microlens just as well.)
  .
  Note that microlens has /no/ dependencies starting from GHC 7.10 (base-4.8). Prior to that, it has to depend on transformers-0.2 or above.
