synopsis:            Generate a special combinator from any data type.

-- A longer description of the package.
description: 
  This library provides a function to generate a special combinator from any data type (GADTs are not currently supported).

  This was inspired by the recursion-schemes library where they have a function to automagically generate a base functor. Although, this new base functor data type has custom constructors and to define the *-morphism algebras turns into boring pattern matching.

  So, this library provides a function called `makeCombinator` that produces a
  nice combinator to deal with data types as they were defined in terms of Pairs
  ( (,) ) and Sums (`Either`). With this nice combinator we are able to view a
  data type as its equivalent categorical isomorphism and manipulate it with an
  interface similar as the `either` function provided from `base`.
