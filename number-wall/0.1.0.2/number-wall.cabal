synopsis: Create number walls and save them as images

description:
  A "number wall" is an infinite grid associated to some (bi-directional) sequence.
  The "numbers" in the grid are usually either integers, or integers modulo some prime.
  Number walls can be defined in terms of determinants, but can also be calculated
  using a recursive algorithm.
  .
  Here are some cool images created using the functions in this package:
