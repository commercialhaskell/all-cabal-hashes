name:           unbeliever
version:        0.10.0.8
synopsis:       Opinionated Haskell Interoperability
description:    A library to help build command-line programs, both tools and
                longer-running daemons. Its @Program@ type provides unified ouptut &
                logging, command-line option parsing, exception handling, and a place to
                put top-level application state. There's also an underlying @Rope@ text
                type built on a finger tree of UTF-8 fragments along with conveniences
                for pretty printing and colourizing terminal output.
                .
                A description of this package, a list of features, and some background
                to its design is contained in the
                <https://github.com/aesiniath/unbeliever/blob/master/README.markdown README>
                on GitHub.
                .
                Useful starting points in the documentation are
                <../core-program/docs/Core-Program-Execute.html Core.Program.Execute> and
                <../core-text/docs/Core-Text-Rope.html Core.Text.Rope>.
                .
                An ancillary purpose of this library is to facilitate interoperability
                between different package families and ecosystems. Having a single
                batteries-included package (as was originally the case) made using it
                easier, but the resulting dependency footprint was considerable and
                growing. The code is thus now spread across several packages:
                .
                * __core-text__
                * __core-data__
                * __core-program__
                .
                with more forthcoming as we continue to add convenince and
                interoperability wrappers around streaming, webservers, and database
                access patterns.
