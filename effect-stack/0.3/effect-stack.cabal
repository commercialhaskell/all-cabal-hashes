synopsis:            Reducing the pain of transformer stacks with duplicated effects
description:         The @mtl@ provides a nice way to write monadic actions
                     which take advantage of a particular kind of effect (say,
                     statefulness or exception handling) without being forced
                     to say exactly which monad is providing that effect.
                     However, if a transformer stack includes two transformers
                     that provide the given effect, @mtl@ does not provide a
                     clean way to disambiguate which one is wanted; the topmost
                     one is always chosen.
                     .
                     This package provides tools for disambiguating without
                     being forced to choose a particular transformer stack. It
                     provides a separate stack for each kind of effect; you may
                     then disambiguate by depth within each stack. For example,
                     in a stack with two @StateT@ transformers, one can write
                     .
                     @foo :: MonadStateDepth 0 m a => m a
                     foo = depthState \@0 get@
                     .
                     for access to the topmost state effects, or
                     .
                     @bar :: MonadStateDepth 1 m a => m a
                     bar = depthState \@1 get@
                     .
                     for access to the state from underneath the topmost
                     @StateT@, no matter how deep in the stack the two
                     @StateT@s are.
                     .

                     examples, and documentation.
