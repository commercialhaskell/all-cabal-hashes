synopsis:       Integer singletons with flexible representation
description:    This provides singletons-style witnesses for type-level integers, and some
                limited arithmetic operations on them.  Instead of working with (invisible,
                implicitly-passed) 'KnownNat' instances, you can work with (visible,
                explicitly-mentioned) 'SNumber' values, and can freely convert between the
                two forms.
                .
                This primarily exists in support of
