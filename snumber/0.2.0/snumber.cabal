synopsis:       Integer singletons with flexible representation
description:    This provides singletons-style witnesses for type-level integers, and some
                limited arithmetic operations on them.  Instead of working with (invisible,
                implicitly-passed) 'KnownNat' instances, you can work with (visible,
