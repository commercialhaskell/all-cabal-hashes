version:             0.2
synopsis:            Common types for IRC related packages
description:
  This library provides types useful to programs and libraries working with
  Internet Relay Chat (IRC). It allows basic IRC concepts like channel,
  nickname, message and so on to be used by IRC parsers and IRC clients and IRC
  servers without unnecessary duplication of type definitions.
  .
  Note that the library possibly doesn't yet fully handle all the types related
  to the various IRC messages types, for example user and channel modes. These
  are added gradually, and patches are welcome.
  .
  All the text based types use strict 'Data.Text.Text'. This allows efficient
  processing of message text while supporting character-based operations that
  require recognizing Unicode.
  .
  If you are writing a simple IRC client module, you can probably use
  "Network.Irc.Types.Base", which contains the subset you'll likely need.
  But if you're writing an IRC message parser or serializer, you'll probably
  want to use "Network.Irc.Types", which contains all the types.
