description:
    Data types representing the digits zero through nine.
    .
    == Modules
    .
    Each of the following modules defines a different type named
    @D10@, all of which are different representations of the same
    concept:
    .
    * "Data.D10.Char" - Defines a @D10@ type as a newtype for @Char@,
      where the values are restricted to characters between @'0'@ and
      @'9'@.
    * "Data.D10.Num" - Defines a @D10@ type as a newtype for any
      type with an instance of the @Num@ class, where the values
      are restricted to numbers between @fromInteger 0@ and
      @fromInteger 9@.
    * "Data.D10.Safe" - Defines a @D10@ type as
      @D0 | D1 | D2 | ... | D9@.
    .
    Other modules:
    .
    * "Data.D10.Predicate" - Functions to test whether values of
      various types represent digits in the range /0/ to /9/.
    .
    == Quasi-quoters
    .
    Each module that defines a @D10@ type also defines quasi-quoters
    for it. With the @QuasiQuotes@ GHC extension enabled, a single
    digit like /7/ can be written as @[d10|7|]@, and a list of digits
    like /[4,5,6]/ can be written as @[d10|456|]@. For "Data.D10.Char"
    and "Data.D10.Num", the quasi-quoters are an important feature,
    because the @D10@ types defined in these modules have unsafe
    constructors, and the quasi-quoters provide compile-time assurance
    that we never construct a @D10@ that represents a value outside
    the range /0/ to /9/. For "Data.D10.Safe", the quasi-quoter is
    offered merely as a possible convenience, allowing you to write
    @[d10|456789|]@ in place of the somewhat longer expression
    @[D4,D5,D6,D7,D8,D9]@.
