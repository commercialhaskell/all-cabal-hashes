Name:           BlogLiterately
Version:        0.5.1
Synopsis:       A tool for posting Haskelly articles to blogs
Description:    Write blog posts in Markdown format, then use BlogLiterately
                to do syntax highlighting, format ghci sessions, and upload
                to any blog supporting the metaWeblog API (such as Wordpress).
                .
                To get started, use the provided executable
                @BlogLiterately@; see
                <http://byorgey.wordpress.com/blogliterately/> for
                complete documentation.
                .
                To make further customization possible, the internals
                of the executable are made available as a library.  In
                particular, it is easy to create your own executable
                which adds extra custom transformations; see
                "Text.BlogLiterately.Run".
                .
                Note that BlogLiterately depends on blaze-html-0.5.
                Pandoc 1.9.3 and later can depend on either
                blaze-html-0.4 or blaze-html-0.5, but the latter only
                in case the blaze_html_0_5 flag is set.  If pandoc is
                installed as a dependency of BlogLiterately,
                everything should work out fine, since cabal's
                constraint solver will figure out to set that flag.
                But if pandoc is already installed against
                blaze-html-0.4 you may need to reinstall it with the
                blaze_html_0_5 flag explicitly set.
