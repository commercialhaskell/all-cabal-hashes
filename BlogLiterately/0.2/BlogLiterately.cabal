Name:           BlogLiterately
Version:        0.2
Synopsis:	A tool for posting Haskelly articles to blogs

Description:     BlogLiterately is a tool for uploading web log posts to web log servers
                 that support the MetaWeblog API (such as WordPress-based blogs and many
                 others).  Blog posts to be published via BlogLiterately are written in
                 markdown [1] format, with extensions supported by pandoc [2].  Posts may be
                 actual 'bird-style' literate Haskell files, with commentary in markdown.
                 Code segments (including actual source lines from literate haskell files,
                 as well as markdown code blocks) may be syntax-highlighted in the resulting
                 HTML that is posted to the blog.  There are two types (two different
                 libraries used) of formatting available for formatting code segments.
                 .
                   * Hscolour (for formatting Haskell code segments)
                 .
                   * highlighting-kate (for formatting Haskell and non-haskell segments)
                 .
                 The Markdown webpage has information about markdown formatting options,
                 and the Pandoc website has information about the extensions supported.
                 BlogLiterately extends the notation a bit further, for specifying code
                 segments.  In basic markdown, A code segment is set off from normal
                 text via indentation, e.g.:
                 .
                 >   -- This is a code segment but the tool doesn't know what kind!
                 >   foo :: String -> String
                 .
                 Pandoc offers another way to specify a code segment (replace the
                 square braces with curly braces, haddock/hackage mangles them):
                 .
                 > ~~~~ [ .haskell ] 
                 > -- This is a code segment, and the tool knows it's Haskell!
                 > foo :: String -> String 
                 > ~~~~
                 .
                 BlogLiterately lets you specify a Haskell segment this way (this is
                 just a normal markdown indented code block with an extra tag at
                 the top.  In either the above way of specifying the type of code
                 in the block, you may specify other kinds of code besides haskell,
                 e.g. cpp, bash, java, ml, eiffel, etc.):
                 .
                 >     [haskell]
                 >     -- This is a code segment, and the tool knows it's Haskell!
                 >     foo :: String -> String
                 .
                 Once you have written your markdown file, you can run the tool, specifying how
                 you want it highlighted.  You can specify different highlighting modes for
                 the haskell segments and the other code segments.  If using hscolour, you
                 can specify that the highlighting be done 'inline' via CSS 'style'
                 attributes.  You can use the default styling (which is similar to source
                 code in documentation on hackage) or you can specify a configuration file
                 which looks something like this:
                 .
                 >     [("hs-keyword","color: blue; font-weight: bold;")
                 >     , ("hs-keyglyph","color: red;")
                 >     , ("hs-layout","color: red;")
                 >     , ("hs-comment","color: green;")
                 >     , ("hs-conid", "")
                 >     , ("hs-varid", "")
                 >     , ("hs-conop", "")
                 >     , ("hs-varop", "")
                 >     , ("hs-str", "color: teal;")
                 >     , ("hs-chr", "color: teal;")
                 >     , ("hs-number", "")
                 >     , ("hs-cpp", "")
                 >     , ("hs-selection", "")
                 >     , ("hs-variantselection", "")
                 >     , ("hs-definition", "")]
                 .
                 It has to be (readable as) a Haskell value of type [(String,String)],
                 and it will only have an effect if you use the above class names (e.g.
                 'hs-keyword' to specify a style for Haskell keywords).
                 .
                 With highlighting-kate (always) and with hscolour
                 (optionally), the style for syntax segments is specified using 'class'
                 attributes, so the stylesheet must be provided separately.  Sample 
                 stylesheets are provided in the package archive file.
                 .
                 To use the highlighting-kate, you must (re)install Pandoc with highlighting
                 enabled, like so:
                 .
                 > cabal install -fhighlighting pandoc
                 .
                 or
                 .
                 > cabal install --reinstall -fhighlighting pandoc
                 .
                 (If you have already installed BlogLiterately, you must reinstall that
                 as well).
                 .
                 The options for BlogLiterately are, I hope, self-explanatory (given the 
                 above background!).  Note that if Pandoc isn't installed with highlighting
                 enabled, there will be fewer options (no -kate options):
                 .

                 >      --postid=VALUE     Post to replace (if any)
                 .
                 .
                 To post to a WordPress blog, the command is:
                 .
                 >     BlogLiterately http://blogurl.example.com/xmlrpc.php \
                 >         myname mypasswd "Sample" Sample.lhs
                 .
                 (which creates a new post).  If, for example, the post id of that post
                 (which BlogLiterately prints when it uploads a new post) was '37', then
                 to update the post, the command would be:
                 .
                 >     BlogLiterately --postid=37 http://blogurl.example.com/xmlrpc.php \
                 >         myname mypasswd "Sample" Sample.lhs
                 .
                 and the post will be updated with the new text.
                 .
