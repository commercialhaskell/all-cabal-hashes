description:
  .
  Wumpus is a low-level library for generating static 2D vector 
  pictures, its salient feature is portability due to no FFI 
  dependencies. It can generate PostScript (EPS) files and SVG 
  files. The generated PostScript code is plain [1] and reasonably 
  efficient as the use of stack operations, i.e @gsave@ and 
  @grestore@, is minimized.
  .
  Pictures in Wumpus are made from /paths/ and text /labels/. 
  Paths themselves are made from points. The usual affine 
  transformations (rotations, scaling, translations) can be
  applied to Pictures. Unlike PostScript there is no 
  notion of a current point, Wumpus builds pictures in a
  coordinate-free style. 
  .
  GENERAL DRAWBACKS...
  .
  For actually drawing pictures, diagrams, etc. Wumpus is very 
  low level. There is a supplemantary package @wumpus-basic@ 
  available that helps create certain types of diagram, but it is
  experimental - functionality is added and dropped between 
  releases.
  .
  Some of the design decisions made for Wumpus-core are not 
  sophisticated (e.g. how attributes like colour are handled, 
  and how the bounding boxes of text labels are calculated), so 
  Wumpus might be limited compared to other systems. However, 
  the design permits a fairly simple implementation, which is a 
  priority. 
  .
  .
  \[1\] Because the output is simple, straight-line PostScript 
  code, it is possible to use GraphicsMagick or a similar tool 
  to convert EPS files generated by Wumpus to many other formats 
  (bitmaps). 
  .
  Changelog:
  .
  0.32.0 to 0.33.0:
  .
  * Major change - reworked support for text encoding. Encoding 
    maps are now linked with fonts - it was spotted that the 
    Symbol font does not use the Latin1 names. The @TextEncoder@ 
    data type has been changed and there is a new @FontEncoder@ 
    data type. There are also new modules for the Symbol Font 
    encoder table and for the /Default Encoder/ which 
    accommodates both Latin1 and the Symbol font. This has also 
    mandated changes to the @FontFace@ data type.
  . 
  * Major change - the printing order has been changed. The first 
    element in a @frame@ of Prims is draw first. This means it 
    appears first in the output file (this makes sense) - it also 
    means it is at the back in the Z-Order. This latter point 
    might not be so intuitive, but changing the printing order at 
    least makes Wumpus-Core match SVG and PostScript.
  .
  * Changed the visiblity of the new colours (yellow, cyan, 
    magenta) to be hidden at the top level. They can be exposed
    by importing @Wumpus.Core.Colour@. 
  .
  * @Wumpus.Core.FontSize@ - added @spacerWidth@ function.
