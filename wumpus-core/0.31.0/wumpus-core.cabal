description:
  .
  Wumpus is a kernel library for generating 2D vector pictures, 
  its salient feature is portability due to no FFI dependencies. 
  It can generate PostScript (EPS) files and SVG files. The 
  generated PostScript code is plain [1] and reasonably 
  efficient as the use of stack operations, i.e @gsave@ and 
  @grestore@, is minimized.
  .
  Pictures in Wumpus are made from /paths/ and text /labels/. 
  Paths themselves are made from points. The usual affine 
  transformations (rotations, scaling, translations) can be
  applied to Pictures. Unlike PostScript there is no 
  notion of a current point, Wumpus builds pictures in a
  coordinate-free style. 
  .
  GENERAL DRAWBACKS...
  .
  For actually drawing pictures, diagrams, etc. Wumpus is very 
  low level. There is a supplemantary package @wumpus-basic@ 
  available that helps create certain types of diagram, but it is
  experimental - functionality is added an dropped between 
  releases.
  .
  Some of the design decisions made for wumpus-core are not 
  sophisticated (e.g. how attributes like colour are handled, 
  and how the bounding boxes of text labels are calculated), so 
  Wumpus might be limited compared to other systems. However, 
  the design permits a fairly simple implementation, which is a 
  priority. 
  .
  \[1\] Because the output is simple, straight-line PostScript 
  code, it is possible to use GraphicsMagick or a similar tool 
  to convert Wumpus'\s EPS files to many other formats 
  (bitmaps). 
  .
  Changelog:
  .
  0.30.0 to 0.31.0:
  .
  * Extended the label type to optionally handle horizontal
    or vertical \"kerning\". This can be efficiently implemented 
    in SVG.
  .
  * Major API change - the Primitive constructors defined in 
    @Core.PictureLanguage@ are no longer overloaded (@cstroke@, 
    @ostroke@, @fill@, @textlabel@, @ellipse@). The respective 
    classes (@Stroke@, @TextLabel@, @Ellipse@) have been removed
    and the constructors now have monomorphic types. This is 
    because Wumpus-Core now only has one colour type and stroke
    attributes are now a single type, so polymorphism became
    less useful (and the simplicity of monomorphic types became
    more favourable). @ellipse@ is no longer a constructor 
    instead there variants @fillEllipse@ and @strokeEllipse@.
  .
  * Added support for /bordered/ closed paths - i.e. paths that
    are both stroked and filled. These can be efficiently drawn 
    in SVG with a single @path@ element.
  .
  * Changed StrokeAttr representation to be a regular data type
    rather than a list of /deltas/ - i.e. differences to the 
    graphics state.
  .
  * Added SVG font attribute /delta optimizations/ to help reduce 
    SVG code size - via the @fontDeltaContext@ function in 
    @Core.Picture@. This functionality was partially inplemented 
    in the last release using the @GSUpdate@ datatype - this 
    datatype it is now called @FontCtx@.
  .
  * Some internal work documenting text encoding.
  .
  0.23.0 to 0.30.0:
  .
  * Substantial changes - the output machinery has been heavily 
    modified, the intention was to reduce the use of matrix 
    transformations in SVG output. Though this goal has not been 
    achieved, some code-size improvements in the SVG output have 
    been made. 
  .
  * The code generation monads have been changed - Wumpus no 
    longer uses a writer monad for code generation, but it will
    keep the Wumpus name.
  .
  * Added support for hyperlinks in the SVG output.
  .
  * Improved internal pretty printing and added the function 
    @printPicture@ for debugging.
  .
  * The @Core.Colour@ module has been simplified to support just 
    one (new) type - RGBi, and the conversion type class 
    @PSColour@ has been eliminated.
  .
  * @Core.Picture@ - the type of the @frame@ function has been 
    changed to take a list of Primitives rather than a single 
    Primitive. The function @frameMulti@ which previously 
    provided this functionality has been removed. SVG hyperlinks
    are now supported for Primitives. 
  . 
  * The default font size has been changed to 14 pt. 
  .
  * The Path datatype has been renamed PrimPath, likewise Ellipse 
    is now PrimEllispe and Label becomes PrimLabel.
  .
  * @Core.Geometry@ now longer defines an affine frame datatype.
  .
  * @Core.BoundingBox@ module changed significantly. The corner 
    functions (@boundaryBottomLeft@, etc.) have been removed, 
    along with the plane functions (@leftPlane@, etc.). Some 
    functions have been given more verbose names - @corners@ is 
    now @boundaryCorners@, @within@ is now @withinBoundary@ and 
    @union@ is now @boundaryUnion@. 
  .
