description:
  Wumpus - (W)riter (M)onad (P)ost (S)cript. 
  .
  Wumpus is a library for generating 2D vector pictures, its 
  salient feature is portability due to no FFI dependencies. 
  It can generate PostScript (EPS) files and SVG files. The 
  generated PostScript code is plain [1] and quite efficient 
  (no unnecessary stack operations).
  .
  Pictures in Wumpus are made from /paths/ and text /labels/. 
  Paths themselves are made from points. The usual affine 
  transformations (rotations, scaling, translations) can be
  applied to all geometric objects. Unlike PostScript there 
  is no notion of a current point, Wumpus builds pictures in a
  coordinate-free style. There is a set of combinators for 
  composing pictures (more-or-less similar to the usual pretty
  printing combinators).
  .
  THE DRAWBACKS...
  .
  For actually drawing pictures, diagrams, etc. Wumpus is very 
  low level. I am working on a complementary package 
  @wumpus-extra@ with higher-level stuff (polygons, arrows etc.)
  but it is too unstable for Hackage. Preview releases can be
  found at <http://code.google.com/p/copperbox/> though.
  .
  Wumpus-core should be fairly stable from now on. There may be 
  some name changes etc. that will change interfaces, but Wumpus 
  has been carefully implemented. Some of the design decisions 
  are not sophisticated (e.g. how attributes like colour are 
  handled, and the bounding boxes of text labels are calculated), 
  so Wumpus might be limited compared to other systems. However 
  its design permits a simple implementation - which is a 
  priority. Text encoding an exception, I\'m not sure how 
  reasonable the design is. The current implementation appears 
  okay for Latin 1 but I\'m not sure about other character sets, 
  and I may have to revise it significantly.
  .
  /There is no documentation/ - the graphics model used by 
  Wumpus is different to PostScript or SVG, and Wumpus really 
  needs a manual. Unfortunately there isn\'t one yet, and I will 
  be focusing on @wumpus-extra@ for the foreseeable future; so a
  manual won\'t be written soon. If you want FFI-free vector
  graphics and Wumpus seems to otherwise fit the task, please 
  email me and I will try to help.
  .
  \[1\] Because the output is simple, straight-line PostScript 
  code, it is possible to use GraphicsMagick or a similar tool to 
  convert Wumpus'\s EPS files to many other formats (bitmaps).

  Changelog:
  .
  0.12.0 to 0.13.0:
  .
  * More Haddock documenting. 
  .
  * @lowerLeftUpperRight@ removed from "Wumpus.Core.BoundingBox".
  .
  * Added range checking and Ord obligation to the @bbox@ 
    \'smart\' constructor.
  .
  * Numeric instances for "Wumpus.Core.Colour" improved.
  .
  * MatrixMult type class simplified
  .
  * Dash Pattern made a list of on-off pairs rather than just a 
    list 
  .
  * The modules - Wumpus.Core.PictureInternal, Wumpus.Core.PostScript,
    Wumpus.Core.SVG & Wumpus.Core.Utils - are no longer exposed.
  .
  * Various operators in "Wumpus.Core.PictureLanguage" changed.
  .
  * Wumpus.Core.TextEncoding split into an internal and a public 
    module (internal - Wumpus.Core.TextEncodingInternal, public - 
    Wumpus.Core.TextEncoder).
