  Wumpus - (W)riter (M)onad (P)ost (S)cript. 
  .
  Wumpus is a library for generating 2D vector pictures, its 
  salient feature is portability due to no FFI dependencies. 
  It can generate PostScript (EPS) files and SVG files. The 
  generated PostScript code is plain [1] and reasonably 
  efficient as the use of stack operations, i.e @gsave@ and 
  @grestore@ is minimized.
  .
  Pictures in Wumpus are made from /paths/ and text /labels/. 
  Paths themselves are made from points. The usual affine 
  transformations (rotations, scaling, translations) can be
  applied to geometric objects. Unlike PostScript there 
  is no notion of a current point, Wumpus builds pictures in a
  coordinate-free style. 
  .
  With recent revisions, I\'ve added some extra helper modules
  that are not really part of the \"core\", but they provide 
  lists of named colours and /safe/ fonts, plus some code  
  (Extra.PictureLanguage) that has been moved out of the
  wumpus-core namespace because it is somewhat \"higher-level\". 
  .
  WARNING...
  .
  With revision 0.18.0, I\'ve changed the internals a bit so that 
  Primitives (paths, text labels) support affine transformations. 
  In the end, this didn\'t changed the API significantly, though 
  with the next revision, I want to look at changing the 
  PostScript output - swapping some uses of @concat@ to @moveto@; 
  so again there is the possibility of significant changes 
  between this revision and the next one.
  .
  Also the module, Core.BoundingBox, is still a candidate for 
  reworking, as it has too many functions that do not offer 
  distinct functionality. Some functions were removed in 
  revision 0.17.0 and some more are likely to follow. 
  .
  NOTE...
  .
  One consequence of adding affine transformations for primitives
  is that the bounding box of a primitive under transformation 
  may be tighter than than the bounding box of transformed 
  picture containing the same primitive, i.e.:
  . 
  @liftToPicture (transform PRIM) /= transform (liftToPicture PRIM)@
  .
  Where liftToPicture is usually @frame@ from 
  @Wumpus.Core.Picture@.
  .
  This is because the bounding box of a transformed picture is 
  calculated by applying the transformation to the corner points 
  of its (previous) bounding box rather than finding the bounding 
  box union of all the composite primitives.
  .
  GENERAL DRAWBACKS...
  .
  For actually drawing pictures, diagrams, etc. Wumpus is very 
  low level. I\'m working on a complementary package 
  @wumpus-extra@ with higher-level stuff (polygons, arrows etc.)
  but it is too unstable for Hackage. Preview releases can be
  found at <http://code.google.com/p/copperbox/> though.
  .
  Some of the design decisions made for wumpus-core are not 
  sophisticated (e.g. how attributes like colour are 
  handled, and how the bounding boxes of text labels are 
  calculated), so Wumpus might be limited compared to other 
  systems. However, the design permits a simple implementation - 
  which is a priority. Text encoding an exception - I\'m not 
  sure how reasonable the design is. The current implementation 
  appears okay for Latin 1 but may be inadequate for other 
  character sets, so I may have to revise it significantly.
  .
  .
  \[1\] Because the output is simple, straight-line PostScript 
  code, it is possible to use GraphicsMagick or a similar tool to 
  convert Wumpus'\s EPS files to many other formats (bitmaps).

  Changelog:
  .
  0.17.0 to 0.18.0:
  .
  * Added instances of the affine operation classes (Scale, 
    Rotate ...) for Primitives (path, text label, ellipse).
  .
  * Added some picture composition functions to Core.Picture.
    These are useful for testing where the type class 
    complications of Extra.PictureLanguage are an overhead.  
  .
  * Added iRGB to Core.Colour - create RGB colours with 
    integer components [0..255] - and iHSB, iGrey.
  .
  * Added some test modules for the affine transformations.
    These illustrate a quirk in Wumpus where, under affine 
    transformation, Pictures may generate a larger bounding box 
    than composite primitives.
  .
  * Minor change - ztextlabal changed to use 24pt type rather 
    than 12pt. 
  .
  * Corrected the cabal file to include the correct files for 
    the manual. The Haskell source file @WorldFrame.hs@ was 
    missing with the generated file @WorldFrame.eps@ incorrectly 
    included instead.
  .
  0.16.0 to 0.17.0:
  .
  * Added Core.WumpusTypes to export opaque versions of
    datatypes from Core.PictureInternal. This should make
    the Haddock documentation more cohesive.
  . 
  * Moved the Core.PictureLanguage module into the Extra
    namespace (Extra.PictureLanguage). This module may change
    in detail, if not in spirit in the future as I'm not 
    very happy with it. Also this module is somewhat 
    \"higher-level\" than the modules in wumpus-core, so 
    a different home seems fitting. 
  . 
  * Removed CardinalPoint and boundaryPoint from BoundingBox.
  .
  * Argument order of 'textlabel' and 'ztextlabel' changed so
    that Point2 is the last argument.
  .
  * PathSegment constructor names changed - this is an internal
    change as the constructors are not exported.
  .
  * Primitive type changed - moved Ellipse properties into 
    PrimEllipse type - internal change.
  .
  * Removed dependency on \'old-time\'.
  .
  0.15.0 to 0.16.0:
  .
  * Additions to Core.Geometry (direction, pvec, vangle, 
    circularModulo).
  .
  * Fixed error with langle due to not accounting for circle 
    quadrants in Core.Geometry.
  .
  * Point2 now derives Ord - so it can be used as a key for
    Data.Map.
  .
  * Added escape-character handling to text output in PostScript.
    This was causing a nasty bug where a drawing would completely
    fail when special chars shown (GhostView gives little hint of 
    what is wrong when such errors are present).
  . 
  * Changed BoundingBox operation 'corners' to return a 4-tuple
    rather than a list.
  .  
  * Added centeredAt to PictureLanguage
  .
