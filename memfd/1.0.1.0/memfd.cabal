synopsis: Open temporary anonymous Linux file handles
category: Filesystem, Linux

description:
    "memfd" (__mem__ory __f__ile __d__escriptor) lets us open pseudo-"files" that are not actually stored in the "real" file system. This feature is only available on Linux.

    Such a file is described as an "anonymous file". It behaves like a regular file, and so can be modified, truncated, memory-mapped, and so on. However, unlike a regular file, it lives in RAM and has a volatile backing storage. Once all references to the file are dropped, it is automatically released.

    The recommended way to import this library is:

    @
    import qualified Memfd
    @

    There is one central function:

    @
    create :: CreateOptions -> IO Fd
    @

    [Fd](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/System-Posix-Types.html#t:Fd) stands for "file descriptor". Here are some things you can do with a file descriptor:

    - [Set the file size](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unix/docs/System-Posix-Files.html#v:setFdSize)
    - [Map the file](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/shared-memory/docs/MMAP.html#v:mmap) into your process's memory space
    - [Send the file descriptor](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/network/docs/Network-Socket.html#v:sendFd) over a Unix-domain socket to share the memory with another process
    - [Close the file](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unix/docs/System-Posix-IO.html#v:closeFd) and allow its contents to get garbage collected by the operating system
