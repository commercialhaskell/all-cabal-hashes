Name:                storable-enum
Version:             0.0
Synopsis:            Wrapper that makes any Enum type Storable
Description:
  In foreign function interfaces you will often want to use enumeration types
  but defining 'Storable' instances is cumbersome.
  This package provides the type @Enum.Storable.T w e@,
  where e.g. @Enum.Storable.T Word8 Ordering@
  means that values of type 'Ordering' are stored in a 'Word8'.
  The 'Storable' methods store the numeric values of the enumeration elements
  as obtained by 'fromEnum'.
  E.g. 'EQ' is stored as @1@.
  The type itself stores a Haskell enumeration element,
  such that GHC can apply all of its optimizations for enumerations.
  It is not checked, whether the storage type @w@ is large enough
  to hold all admissible numeric values of @e@.
  It is also not checked, whether the storage type @w@ supports negative values
  whenever the enumeration of @e@ contains ones.
  .
  See the @bool8@ package for the special case of a 'Bool' stored in a 'Word8'.
