Name:                luautils
Version:             0.1
Synopsis:            Helpers for Haskell integration with Lua
Description:         This package is an add-on to the @HsLua@ package by Gracjan Polak.
                     HsLua only provides a very bare-bones wrapper over the Lua API, and this
                     package is meant to fill in the gap by providing some commonly used features.
