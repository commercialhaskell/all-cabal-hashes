synopsis:            Utility libraries for Quipper.

-- A longer description of the package.
description:         

 This package provides some utility libraries for Quipper, the
 embedded functional programming language for quantum computing. These
 libraries are used by Quipper, but do not depend on it. They provide
 general-purpose functionality that could in principle be used by
 other programs, but are are not sufficiently interesting to warrant
 their own packages.
