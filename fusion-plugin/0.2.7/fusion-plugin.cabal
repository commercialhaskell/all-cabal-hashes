synopsis:            GHC plugin to make stream fusion more predictable.
description:
  This plugin provides the programmer with a way to annotate certain
  types using a 'Fuse' pragma from the
  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fusion-plugin-types fusion-plugin-types>
  package. The programmer would annotate the types that are to be
  eliminated by fusion. During the simplifier phase the plugin goes
  through the relevant bindings and if one of these types are found
  inside a binding then that binding is marked to be inlined
  irrespective of the size.
  .
  This plugin was primarily motivated by
  <https://streamly.composewell.com streamly> but it can
  be used in general.
