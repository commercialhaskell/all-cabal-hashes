synopsis:         High-level drawing objects built on Wumpus-Basic.
description:
  .
  \*\* WARNING \*\* - this package is sub-alpha. Although many of 
  the drawing objects have been improved since the code was split 
  from Wumpus-Basic, the code is still prototypical. Essentially
  this package is a /technology preview/ and not yet a re-usable 
  library.
  .
  NOTE - many of the demos use font metrics. Font metrics for
  the \"Core 14\" PostScript fonts are distributed as @*.afm@ 
  files with GhostScript in the @fonts@ directory. Wumpus expects
  the GhostScript font metrics to be AFM version 2.0 files (this
  matches GhostScript 8.63). Alternatively, metrics for the Core 
  14 fonts are available from Adode (AFM version 4.1), see the 
  links below. To run the demos properly you will need one of 
  these sets of metrics.

  .
  Also note that Wumpus uses fallback metrics (derived from the
  monospaced Courier font) when font loading fails, rather than
  throwing a terminal error. Applications should ideally check
  the font loading log to ensure that fonts have loaded correctly
  (the demos print this log to standard out).

  Changelog:
  .
  v0.4.0 to v0.5.0
  .
  * Re-implemented Text drawing. Some functionality moved to 
    Wumpus-Basic.
  .
  * Re-implemented monadic Path Builder.
  .
  v0.3.0 to v0.4.0:
  .
  * Simplified Trapezium shape so it only produces isosceles
    Trapeziums.
  .
  * Added Basis modules. These are \"mid-level\" modules similar 
    to ones in @Wumpus.Basic.Kernel.Objects@, however they are 
    considered less general so there are put here where they can 
    be imported individually (and so not pollute the namespace).
  .
  * Removed the Turtle modules. The new @LocTrace@ and @RefTrace@ 
    modules supercede the Turtle modules.
