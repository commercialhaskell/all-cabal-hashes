description:
    CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your AWS
    account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded
    information includes the identity of the user, the start time of the
    AWS API call, the source IP address, the request parameters, and the
    response elements returned by the service.
