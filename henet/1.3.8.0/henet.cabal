Name:                 henet
Version:              1.3.8.0
Synopsis:             Bindings and high level interface for to ENet v1.3.8
Description:
  ENet is a networking library on top of UDP. In it's own words:
  .
    "ENet's purpose is to provide a relatively thin, simple and robust network
    communication layer on top of UDP (User Datagram Protocol). The primary
    feature it provides is optional reliable, in-order delivery of packets.
    .
    ENet omits certain higher level networking features such as authentication,
    lobbying, server discovery, encryption, or other similar tasks that are
    particularly application specific so that the library remains flexible,
    portable, and easily embeddable."
  .
  This library contains both bindings and a slightly cleaned up interface on
  top. The bindings are as close to the original as possible. Names are striped
  of the leading `enet_` and converted to CamelCase, and the occasional newtype
  is used instead, but otherwise all functions signatures are exactly the
  same. The bindings are in `Network.ENet.Bindings`.
  .
  The higher level interface is all other exposed modules. Functions like
  `enet_host_*` are placed in `Network.ENet.Host`. All functions are present
  except for the `enet_socket*` functions: they are just wrappers of the Posix
  Sockets Interface, which is already provided in Haskell by the `network`
  package. Changes are fairly minimal: "Out-Args" are now returned with a tuple,
  conversions between C and Haskell types happen automatically (when Haskell
  versions exists), and nullable pointer types have been replaced with
  Maybes. In short, there should be very few reasons to use the raw bindings
  over the "nice" interface.
  .
  At the moment, consult the ENet website for documentation. In the vast
  majority of cases the documentation there should apply here exactly, I will
  try to add Haddock documentation for everywhere it does not.
  .
  ENet currently only supports Ipv4 at the moment (though that should soon
  change), and is only safe to use as when used in one thread. Richer native
  networking libraries leveraging Haskell's strengths exist, and for new
  projects I'd recommend those. But for interfacing with existing protocols
  using ENet, this package should be quite useful.
