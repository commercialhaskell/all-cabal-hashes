version: 0.1.0.1
synopsis: icmp echo requests
description:
  This library provides functions that have similar behavior as the
  unix command-line utility ping. In particular, both emit ICMP echo requests
  and wait for responses. This library uses a haskell implementation of ICMP
  rather than invoking `/bin/ping`. This avoids the costly process of starting
  a child process. Additionally, there are greater opportunities for reusing
  sockets. The cost of this is that the user must ensure that one of these
  is true:
  .
  * The kernel parameter `net.ipv4.ping_group_range` has been configured
    to allow pings to all IP addresses. (preferred solution)
  .
  * The process is running with the the `CAP_NET_RAW` capability.
  .
  * The process is running as root. (worst solution)
  .
