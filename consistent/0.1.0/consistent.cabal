Description:
  Eventually consistent STM transactions.
  .
  Consistent provides eventually consistent atomic transactions, by delaying
  updates until no threads is mutating a shared variable.
  .
  This comes at a cost of having a separate TVar for every thread, but has the
  advantage that no thread will ever lock or retry except for the manager actor
  responsible for performing the updates.
