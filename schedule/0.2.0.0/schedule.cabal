Name:                schedule
Version:             0.2.0.0
Synopsis:            Pure deterministic scheduled computations
Description:
  Schedule computations to run later, in a pure and deterministic way.
  .
  This library is a pure alternative to "System.Timeout" suitable for IO-bound
  non-blocking computations. "System.Timeout" has a few issues that are at-odds
  with a Haskell or purely functional paradigm: (1) it is not deterministic,
  (2) the timeout state is not serialisable, and (3) the timeout functionality
  must be shared between unrelated components, making it harder to design
  components that are easily decomposable and reusable.
  .
  This library solves these issues by implementing all schedule and timeout
  logic as a pure deterministic computation, with callbacks represented in
  defunctionalised serialisable form. The interface with the runtime execution
  environment is minimal: a simple source of clock inputs similar to other
  inputs such as network traffic or user commands, which can either be an
  IO-based impure "real" runtime, or a pure "mock" one e.g. that replays
  previous inputs to reproduce previous outputs.
  .
  This library does /no pre-emption/ e.g. by sending interrupts or asynchronous
  exceptions, so it is probably /not suitable/ for blocking computations. To be
  clear, things will /work/, but clock inputs will be delivered only after the
  blocking is over. A workaround is to separate the blocking computations from
  your main computation, arrange to have these run externally (e.g. in worker
  threads) with the results being sent back to your main computation via some
  pure abstract input interface, similar to how we deliver clock inputs.
  .
  If this is not suitable and you absolutely need pre-emption, then you'll need
  a richer runtime interface than the one expected by this library; luckily the
  Haskell runtime itself is such an example. In other words, simply use other
  existing IO-based utilities for setting timeouts, that typically rely on
  concurrency or asynchronous exceptions. But then, you'll have to figure out
  your own way of overcoming the issues mentioned in the first paragraph.
  .
  The original motivation for this library comes from implementing secure
  communications protocols and decentralised distributed systems. In these
  contexts one must often set local timeouts for remote events that may or may
  not happen in the future, or periodically synchronise local views of shared
  data with remote peers. Most operations are IO-bound and can be written to be
  non-blocking; the main exception is heavy cryptography which can be delegated
  to worker threads as described above. Of course, this library is not tied to
  these use-cases and is a general replacement for "System.Timeout".

  See "Control.Monad.Schedule" for the main monad-based API of this library.
  .
  See "Control.Arrow.Schedule" for the main arrow-based API of this library.
  .
  See "Control.Clock.IO" for various ways of combining clock inputs with other
  inputs and injecting them into your pure computations.
  .
  See @Control.Schedule.*@ for higher-level utilities that one often wants to
  use on top of a timeout primitive, such as futures and monitors.
  .
  See unit tests for example usage.
