Name:                reactive
Version:             0.5.0.1
Synopsis: 	     Simple foundation for functional reactive programming
Category:            reactivity, FRP
Description:
  /Reactive/ is a simple foundation for programming reactive systems
  functionally.  Like Fran\/FRP, it has a notions of (reactive) behaviors and
  events.  Like DataDriven, Reactive has a data-driven implementation.
  The main difference between Reactive and DataDriven is that Reactive
  builds on functional \"futures\" (using threading), while DataDriven
  builds on continuation-based computations.
