Synopsis: the noodle programming language


Description:
    The @noodle@ Programming Language Interpreter
    .
    Noodle is two things. It is a programming language, and it is this implementation
    of that programming language.
    .
    /Briefly.../
    .
    Noodle (the language) is functional, latently typed, and statically scoped.
    Noodle has no language level concept of mutable state. 
    Data abstraction is handled with 'scope bound' wrappers that prevent pattern matching on some value outside 
    of some mutually recursive scope. 
    Numbers are arbitrary precision integer ratios. 
    Operators are (possibly) high order functions with special application rules that omit evaluation of the 
    right operand if their application to the left operand does not return a function. 
    Modules are mutually recursive internally, are first class, and can be parameterized by constructing them with functions. 
    Rather than arrays or linked lists, the most basic compound data structure in noodle is a binary tree, or 'product'.
    .
    
    
    .
    the primary points of interest in this package are:
    .
    [@noodle@]      the option directed command line interface
    .
    [@noodle-repl@] the read-eval-print-loop
    .
    [@noodle-eval@] an interface for evaluating a single noodle
                    expression (computation) from stdin
    .
    .
    You may also incorporate noodle into your own program as a library,
    but this is /even less documented/ than the /completely undocumented/ command
    line interface... so I don't know why you would want to do this.
