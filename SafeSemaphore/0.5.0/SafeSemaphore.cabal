Name:                SafeSemaphore
Version:             0.5.0
Synopsis:            Much safer replacement for QSemN, QSem, and SampleVar
Description:         This provides a much safer semaphore than the QSem in base.  Performance has not been compared.  In the source is a tests/TestKillSem.hs executable (run by cabal test) that shows the problem with QSem.
