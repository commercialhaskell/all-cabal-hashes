name:                BiGUL
version:             1.0.0
synopsis:            The Bidirectional Generic Update Language
description:
  Putback-based bidirectional programming allows the programmer to
  write only one putback transformation, from which the unique
  corresponding forward transformation is derived for free. BiGUL,
  short for the Bidirectional Generic Update Language, is designed to
  be a minimalist putback-based bidirectional programming language.
  BiGUL was originally developed in the dependently typed programming
  language Agda, and its well-behavedness has been completely formally
  verified; this package is the Haskell port of BiGUL.
