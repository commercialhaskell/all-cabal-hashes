name:                language-c99
version:             0.1.2
synopsis:            An implementation of the C99 AST that strictly follows the
                     standard.
description:
  This package contains an implementation of the C99 AST as described in
  <http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf>. Sticking closely
  to this standard assures us that the program we deal with is a valid C99
  program.
  .
  Additionally the library comes with a pretty printer.
  .
  The package does not come with handy wrapper and utility functions to write a
  C99 program, it just contains the bare AST. It is highly recommended to use
  the wrapper provided by 'language-c99-simple' and 'language-c99-util' for
  writing programs.
