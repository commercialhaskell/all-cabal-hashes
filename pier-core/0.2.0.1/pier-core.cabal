synopsis:       A library for writing forwards-declared build systems in haskell.
description:    A library for writing build systems in Haskell, built on top of
                <http://shakebuild.com shake>.
                .
                Pier provides a generic approach to building and caching file outputs.
                It enables build actions to be written in a "forwards" style, which
                generally leads to simpler logic than backwards-defined build systems
                such as make or (normal) Shake, where each step of the build logic must
                be written as a new build rule.
                .
                For more details, see "Pier.Core.Artifact".
