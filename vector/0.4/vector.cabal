Category:       Data, Data Structures
Synopsis:       Efficient Arrays
Description:
        .
        An efficient implementation of Int-indexed arrays with a powerful loop
        fusion framework.
        .
        It is structured as follows:
        .
        [@Data.Vector@] boxed vectors of arbitrary types
        .
        [@Data.Vector.Primitive@] unboxed vectors of primitive types as
                defined by the @primitive@ package
        .
        [@Data.Vector.Storable@] unboxed vectors of 'Storable' types
        .
        [@Data.Vector.Generic@] generic interface to the vector types
        .

Flag EnableAssertions
  Description: Enable assertions that check parameters to functions are reasonable.
               These will impose a moderate performance cost on users of the library,
               with the benefit that you get reasonable errors rather than segmentation faults!

-- -finline-if-enough-args is ESSENTIAL. If we don't have this the partial application
-- of e.g. Stream.Monadic.++ to the monad dictionary at the use site in Stream.++ causes
-- it to be fruitlessly inlined. This in turn leads to a huge RHS for Stream.++, so it
-- doesn't get inlined at the final call site and fusion fails to occur.

-- It's probably a good idea to compile the library with -O2 as well. However, it's probably
-- not as essential as you think because most of the optimisation occurs when the library
-- functions from here are inlined into the user programs (which SHOULD be compiled with -O2!).
--
-- We have to fiddle with the assertion stuff at this point too because -O2 implies -fno-ignore-asserts,
-- meaning that their relative ordering is CRUCIAL. Setting them together guarantees it.
