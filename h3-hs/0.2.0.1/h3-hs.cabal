cabal-version:      3.0
-- The cabal-version field refers to the version of the .cabal specification,
-- and can be different from the cabal-install (the tool) version and the
-- Cabal (the library) version you are using. As such, the Cabal (the library)
-- version used must be equal or greater than the version stated in this field.
-- Starting from the specification version 2.2, the cabal-version field must be
-- the first thing in the cabal file.

-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:           A Haskell binding for H3

-- A longer description of the package.
description:        This package provides bindings to the 
                    [H3 C API v4](https://h3geo.org/docs/api/indexing).  
                    H3 is a geospatial indexing system that partitions the world 
                    into hexagonal cells. 
                    
                    For users with experience with bindings for other languages, 
                    we recommend reviewing the project README, as we have 
                    included notes for using the methods provided in this package. 
                    In particular, as we bind to the C methods with few adjustments 
                    to inputs and outputs beyond data marshalling, 
                    there will be some differences for those familiar with the 
                    python (and likely other) bindings, e.g. the methods 
                    provided in this package expect the latitude and longitude 
                    to be in radians rather than degrees.
