description:
  This package provides the ability to join up or wire instances of types (such as ReaderT, WriterT and RWST) with some semi-automatic conversions.
  .
  /ReaderT Example/
  .
  With ReaderT there might be two functions already written that we wish to compose:
  .
  > userLookup :: Int -> ReaderT (Resource1, Database1) IO User
  > ordersLookup :: Int -> ReaderT (Database2, Resource1) IO [String]
  .
  Ordinarily these could not be used together because their environment type differs,
  which reduces the utility of ReaderT as a method of <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection dependency injection>.
  .
  However with use of the @wire@ method from the @Wirable@ typeclass it becomes possible to use these two together with little pain.
  .
  > composedLookup :: Int -> ReaderT (Resource1, Database1, Database2) IO String
  > composedLookup userId = do
  >   user    <- wire $ userLookup userId
  >   orders  <- wire $ ordersLookup userId
  >   return $ describeOrders user orders
  .
  /Tuples/
  .
  Built in are instances of @Wirable@ for transforming tuples to their individual fields, like taking @a@ from a tuple @(a, b, c)@.
  .
  As well as producing new tuples from existing tuples, starting with a tuple of @(a, b, c)@ and returning a tuple of @(c, a)@.
  .
  /Other Types/
  .
  WriterT and RWST are similarly well supported, including the ability to promote from ReaderT\/WriterT up to RWST.
  .
  Some existing functionality is extended like for instance with the @wiredAsk@ and @wiredTell@ functions.
