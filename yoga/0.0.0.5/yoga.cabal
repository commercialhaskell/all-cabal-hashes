synopsis:            Bindings to Facebook's Yoga layout library
description:         The <https://facebook.github.com/yoga Yoga> library from
                     <https://facebook.github.com/ Facebook> is a fast layout engine
                     written in C that implements flexbox. There are two
                     main ways to interface with these bindings. The high-level
                     bindings are stored in the Yoga module and provide a more
                     Haskell-like interface to the library. The other option is to
                     directly use the C-level bindings in "Bindings.Yoga". If you do
                     so you do so at your own risk (i.e. you must manage your own
                     memory).

                     The examples are not built nor included by default. Please
                     refer to the source tarball for examples on how to use this
                     library.

                     These bindings are not affiliated with Facebook in any way,
                     and have been developed separately for the sole purpose of
                     interfacing with their open source library.
