stability:           experimental

synopsis:            Client for the Kattis judge system.
description:         Unofficial CLI client for the Kattis online judge system (currently in BETA).
                     .
                     Written in a git-like fashion, it supports automatic
                     downloading of test cases, easy submissions, and more.
                     .
                     Basically a problem is initialized as follows
                     (creates a directory and downloads any available test cases):
                     .
                     > > katt init hello
                     > > cd hello
                     .
                     Source files, problem names, and language identification is handled 
                     automatically when submitting solutions:
                     .
                     > > vim hello.java
                     > > katt submit
                     > Made submission 4712
                     > Accepted: 1 of 1 test(s) passed
                     .
                     There is also built-in support for problem sessions,
                     which initalizes all problems in the problem list.
                     .
                     Get started by downloading a /.kattisrc/ config from
                     the official site, make sure you have the haskell platform
                     installed, then run /cabal install katt/.
                     .
                     Please note that the beta release is limited to C, C++, Java, and Haskell.
                     It also only supports running on unix.
                     .
                     Changes since last release:
                     .
                       * Support for Haskell submissions
                     .
                       * HTTP client replaced with wreq
                     .
                       * Improved code readability
