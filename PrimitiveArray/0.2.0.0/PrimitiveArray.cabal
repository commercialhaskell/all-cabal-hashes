Synopsis:
                Efficient multidimensional arrays
Description:
                This library provides efficient multidimensional arrays.
                .
                In general all operations are (highly) unsafe, no
                bounds-checking or other sanity-checking is performed.
                Operations are aimed toward efficiency as much as possible.
                Goals of the library are to have arrays according to three
                ideas: immutable/mutable arrays, strict/lazy arrays,
                zero-based/lower-bound arrays. Zero-based arrays save one
                addition on each access if the lower bound or the array is
                always zero.
                .
                We have forked two repa modules: Shape and Index.
