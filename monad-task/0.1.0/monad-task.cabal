synopsis:     A monad transformer that turns event processing into co-routine programming.
description:
    Task monad transformer can help refactor event and callback 
    heavy programs into monads via co-routines. The idea is loosely
    based on /Combining Events And Threads For Scalable Network Services/,
    by Peng Li and Steve Zdancewic, in /PLDI/, 2007.
    (<http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~stevez/papers/abstracts.html#LZ07>), but 
    with deterministic and co-oprative lightweight threads, also known as 
    co-routines, so that the base monad can be anything ranging from IO 
    to state monads, or your favorite monad transformer stack.
