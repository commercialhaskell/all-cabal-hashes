version: 0.2.1
synopsis:
  Adds a module to gtk2hs allowing layouts to be defined using
  reverse polish notation.
description:
  Adds a module "Graphics.UI.Gtk.Layout.Rpn" to @gtk2hs@. This
  module defines a type @RPN@ for operators, which is an
  instance of 'Data.Monoid.Monoid' class.  You can combine those
  operators using reverse polish notation, as made popular by,
  say, HP calculators. There are operators for layout elements,
  like expanders, panes, boxes and notebooks, and for a few
  other widgets, like buttons and labels. You can also insert
  any existing @gtk2hs@ widget in the stack.
