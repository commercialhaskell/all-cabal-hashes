description:
    A rational list is a list that is either finite or of the form
    @xs ++ cycle ys@ where @xs@ and @ys@ are finite lists and @ys@
    is non-empty.  Such lists have a finite representation, supporting
    list operations that terminate even for infinite lists, and are
    often more efficient.
