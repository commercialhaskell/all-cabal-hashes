Name:                bounded-tchan
Version:             0.2.3
Synopsis:            Bounded Transactional channels (queues)
Description:         Bounded TChan's, or BTChan's, are a transactional queue with a limit to the number of elements (further calls to @writeBTChan@ or @unGetBTChan@ call STM retry).  Users are strongly encouraged to consider using the more complete 'stm-chans' packages, which includes a bounded TChan designed on this package.
