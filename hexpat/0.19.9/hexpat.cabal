Cabal-Version: >= 1.6
Name: hexpat
Version: 0.19.9
Synopsis: XML parser/formatter based on expat
Description:
  This package provides a general purpose Haskell XML library using Expat to
  do its parsing (<http://expat.sourceforge.net/> - a fast stream-oriented XML
  parser written in C).  It is extensible to any string type, with @String@,
  @ByteString@ and @Text@ provided out of the box.
  .
  Basic usage: Parsing a tree (/Tree/), formatting a tree (/Format/).
  Other features: Helpers for processing XML trees (/Proc/), trees annotated with
  XML source location (/Annotated/), extended XML trees with comments,
  processing instructions, etc (/Extended/), XML cursors (/Cursor/),
  SAX-style parse (/SAX/), and access to the low-level interface in case speed
  is paramount (/Internal.IO/).
  .
  The design goals are speed, speed, speed, interface simplicity and modularity.
  .
  For introduction and examples, see the /Text.XML.Expat.Tree/ module. For benchmarks,
  <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hexpat/>
  .
  If you want to do interactive I\/O, an obvious option is to use lazy parsing
  with one of the lazy I\/O functions such as hGetContents.  However, this can be
  problematic in some applications because it doesn't handle I\/O errors properly
  and can give no guarantee of timely resource cleanup.  In these cases, chunked
  I\/O is a better approach: Take a look at the /hexpat-enumerator/ package.
  .
  /IO/ is filed under /Internal/ because it's low-level and most users won't want
  it.  The other /Internal/ modules are re-exported by /Annotated/, /Tree/ and /Extended/,
  so you won't need to import them directly.
  .

  Thanks to the many contributors.

  BOUND VS. UNBOUND THREADS: GHC (at least versions 6.12.X) will spawn threads
  if you call a safe FFI callback from an unbound thread.  This can get out of
  control in a busy application.  To avoid this, from version 0.19.1 we now delegate
  processing to a single worker thread if the calling thread is not bound.
  This essentially means that hexpat currently won't exploit multicores very well.
  It also means that hexpat may be more efficient on threads spawned with forkOS
  (to give you a bound thread) rather than forkIO.
  .
  ChangeLog: 0.15 changes intended to fix a (rare) \"error: a C finalizer called back into Haskell.\"
    that seemed only to happen only on ghc6.12.X; 0.15.1 Fix broken Annotated parse;
    0.16 switch from mtl to transformers; 0.17 fix mapNodeContainer & rename some things.;
    0.18 rename defaultEncoding to overrideEncoding. 0.18.3 formatG and indent were demanding list
    items more than once (inefficient in chunked processing); 0.19 add Extended.hs;
    0.19.1 fix a memory leak introduced in 0.19, delegate parsing to bound thread
    if unbound (see note above); 0.19.2 include expat source code so \'cabal install\' just works
    on Linux, Mac and Windows (thanks Jacob Stanley); 0.19.3 fix misconfiguration of expat
    which broke entity parsing; 0.19.4 bump version constraint for text; 0.19.5 bump text
    to < 0.12 and fix text-0.10.0.1 breakage; 0.19.6 dependency breakage with List;
    0.19.7 ghc-7.2.1 compatibility; 0.19.8 fix space leak on lazy parse under ghc-7.2.1;
    0.19.9 fix formatting of > character + improve performance
