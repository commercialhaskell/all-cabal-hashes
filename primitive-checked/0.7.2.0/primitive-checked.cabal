description:
  .
  This library is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement for
  the @primitive@ library in test environments. It adds bounds-checking
  to all functions in @primitive@ that are able to cause segfaults.
  It is not recommended to use this library in production. However,
  if you are testing a library or application you wrote that uses
  @primitive@, you can temporarily replace your @primitive@ dependency
  with @primitive-checked@, and your segfaults will become normal
  Haskell exceptions that you can hunt down with GHC's stack trace
  facilities.
  .
  The versioning for this library matches the version of @primitive@
  that is targeted. The first three numbers of the version match the
  version of @primitive@. The fourth number is used for bug fixes.
  This packages deviates slightly from the PVP in that functions
  can be added to the API with only a bump to the fourth number.
