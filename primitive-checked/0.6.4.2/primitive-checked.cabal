description:
  .
  This library is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement for
  the `primitive` library in test environments. It adds bounds-checking
  to all functions in `primitive` that are able to cause segfaults.
  It is not recommended to use this library in production. However,
  if you are testing a library or application you wrote that uses
  `primitive`, you can temporarily replace your `primitive` dependency
  with `primitive-checked`, and your segfaults will become normal
  haskell exceptions that you can hunt down with GHC's stack trace
  facilities.
  .
  The versioning for this library matches the version of primitive
  that is targeted. The first three digits of the version match the
  version of `primitive`. The fourth digit is used for bug fixes.
  This packages deviates slightly from the PVP in that functions
  can be added to the API with only a bump to the fourth digit.
