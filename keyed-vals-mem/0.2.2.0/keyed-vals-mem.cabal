synopsis:
  Implements a keyed-vals Handle using in-process memory

description:
  keyed-vals provides a typed interface to a storage backend that allows the
  path in the storage backend to be declaratively linked to the types of data
  stored via a straightforward typeclass declaration.

  Read this [short example](https://github.com/adetokunbo/keyed-vals/tree/main/keyed-vals#example)
  for an introduction its usage.

  While the goal of [keyed-vals](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/keyed-vals) is
  to provide access to storage services like [Redis](https://redis.io), the
  abstract definition of __Handle__ also enables this in-process implementation.

  This package, keyed-vals-mem, is intended as a drop-in replacement for use in
  testing and rapid prototyping.
