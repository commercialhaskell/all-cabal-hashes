synopsis:            Location-aware variants of partial functions
description:         This library provides variants of standard partial functions
                     that include their call-site in the error message when they crash.
                     .
                     For example:
                     .
                     @
                       ghci> 'Data.List.Located.head' []
                       *** Exception: Prelude.head: empty list
                       Callstack:
                       \ \ error, called at src\/Data\/List\/Located.hs:19:14 in locat_KhGZ7Rz1bn9DKFeFxhawNB:Data.List.Located
                       \ \ head, called at \<interactive\>:6:1 in interactive:Ghci1
