synopsis: A fountain codec.

description:
  Fountain codes are forward error correction codes for erasure channels.
  They are able to recover lost packets without needed a backchannel.
  As a rateless code, transmitters generate packets at random, on the fly.
  Receivers then listen to as many packets as needed to reconstruct the message.
