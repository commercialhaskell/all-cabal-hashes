synopsis: Asynchronous actions that don't start right away

description:

    Sometimes we have a bunch of 'IO' actions that do things like
    read files, make HTTP requests, or query a database. Some of the
    information that these actions produce might not end up being
    needed, depending on the breaks. In the interest of avoiding
    unnecessary effort, we don't want to simply run all the actions
    and collect their results upfront. We also don't want to simply
    run an action right before its result is needed, because it might
    be needed in more than one place, which opens the possibility of
    unnecessarily running the same action more than once. In
    situations like these, we use "LazyAsync".

    Under the hood, an 'IO' action is turned into a @LazyAsync@ by
    constructing two things: An @Async@ (from the @async@ package),
    and a @TVar Bool@ (from the @stm@ package). The TVar, initialized
    to @False@, indicates whether the action is wanted yet. The async
    thread waits until the TVar turns @True@ and then runs the action.
