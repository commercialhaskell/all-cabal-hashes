synopsis:       Http client with time-limited brRead
description:    Http client with timeouts applied in between body read events.
        .
        Note that the response timeout in /http-client/ is applied only when
        receiving the response headers which is not always satisfactory given
        that a slow server may send the rest of the response very slowly.
