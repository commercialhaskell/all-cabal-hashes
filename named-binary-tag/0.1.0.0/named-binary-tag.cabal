cabal-version:      2.4

name:     named-binary-tag
version:  0.1.0.0
synopsis: NBT (named binary tag) serialization and deserialization.
description: This project was created because the old nbt package has had a 1-liner open issue preventing compilation for 2 years now at the time of writing, despite submitting a pull request to fix it.
    .
    While I was at it, I went ahead and changed the data structure to use konsumlamm's rrb-vector package instead of lists or unboxed arrays for more well-rounded asymptotics.
    .
    StrictData is also turned on, and some functions are exported for reading/writing NBT files that remove some of the old boilerplate code.
