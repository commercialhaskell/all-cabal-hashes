    This package was created in the context of the <https://www.graceful-project.eu/ GRACeFUL project>).
    .
    The haskelzinc library defines an interface to the MiniZinc 2.0 constraint proramming language. It provides a Haskell abstract syntax tree for the MiniZinc language, with which one can represent MiniZinc models in Haskell, a pretty printer to print the representation of a MiniZinc model in MiniZinc and a parser that returns a representation of the solutions obtained by running the MiniZinc model.
    .
    An additional module gives the possibility to directly get the solutions of a MiniZinc finite domain model. Option for interactive interface is provided, as well as choice between two solvers: the G12/FD built-in solver of FlatZinc and choco3.
