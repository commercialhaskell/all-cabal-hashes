description:      
    This package was created in the context of the <https://www.graceful-project.eu GRACeFUL project>.
    .
    The haskelzinc library defines an interface to the MiniZinc 2.1 constraint proramming
    language. It provides a Haskell abstract syntax tree for the MiniZinc language, with 
    which one can represent MiniZinc models in Haskell, a pretty printer to print the 
    representation of a MiniZinc model in MiniZinc, a parser that returns a 
    representation of the solutions obtained by running the MiniZinc model, a set of 
    functions useful for building a custom FlatZinc solutions parser and a set of functions for 
    constructing a model with time and space constraints, including cost related constraints.
    .
    An additional module gives the possibility to directly get the solutions of a 
    MiniZinc finite domain model. Option for interactive interface is provided, as well 
    as choice between two solvers: the G12/FD built-in solver of FlatZinc and choco3.
