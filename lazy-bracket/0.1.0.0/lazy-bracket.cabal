version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            A bracket with lazy resource allocation.
description:         A version of bracket which returns a lazily allocated
                     resource. The allocation happens when (if) the resource 
                     is accessed for the first time.

                     Some control operations can be stashed and applied once the
                     resource is allocated, or skipped altogether if the
                     resource is never allocated.
