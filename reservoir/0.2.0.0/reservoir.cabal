synopsis:            Unweighted reservoir sampling

-- A longer description of the package.
description:
    From <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling>: "Reservoir sampling is a family of randomized algorithms for randomly choosing a sample of k items from a list S containing n items, where n is either a very large or unknown number. Typically n is large enough that the list doesn't fit into main memory."

    This package implements Jeffrey Vitter's Algorithm R <http://www.cs.umd.edu/~samir/498/vitter.pdf>, suitable for unweighted sampling from a collection of unknown size.
