Synopsis:            Pretty-printer for Ott parse trees
Description:         Ott (<http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/ott/>) is a tool for
		     writing formal definitions of programming
		     languages and calculi.  Often the Ott grammars
		     one defines end up being ambiguous, and Ott
		     signals its displeasure by spewing forth several
		     massive parse trees in a format requiring
		     formidable patience to read.  Finding the slight
		     differences between two such parse trees is an
		     exercise in seizure-inducing tedium.
                     .
		     To the rescue comes ottparse-pretty!  Simply
		     paste in each parse and it is shown to you in a
		     nicely formatted tree form with all the extra
		     meaningless cruft removed.
