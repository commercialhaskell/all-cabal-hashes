synopsis:            NF data type to statically enforce normal form 
description:         This package provides a data type NF representing
                     data which has been evaluated to normal form.  This
                     is a useful type discipline for many situations when
                     normal form data is necessary, e.g. when transmitting
                     data to other threads over channels.
