synopsis:            Fast imperative-style loops
description:
  @loops@ is a library for fast, imperative-style loops with a clean syntax.
  .
  Features
  .
  * Fast, imperative-style loops with a clean syntax. Bind (`>>=`) nests loops,
    so in `do`-notation, each subsequent line is nested inside loops that appear
    above it.
  .
  * Iteration over common data structures, like lists and vectors.
  .
  * Robust performance because there is no reliance on fusion.
  .
  * NEW! Loop-unrolling to arbitrary depth. Unrollable loop combinators are
    provided in `Control.Monad.Loop.Unroll`. (The simple, "rolled" interface is
    still provided in `Control.Monad.Loop`.) The unrolling depth set at the call
    site at compile time. My benchmarks show that folding over unrolled loops is
    up to 25% faster than folding over unboxed vectors!
  .
  For best performance, please compile your code with @-O2@. You should also
  use GHC's LLVM backend if possible; it generally produces faster executables.
