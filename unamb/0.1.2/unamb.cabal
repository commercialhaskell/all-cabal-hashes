Name:                unamb
Version:             0.1.2
x-revision: 1
Cabal-Version:       >= 1.2
Synopsis:            Unambiguous choice
Category:            Concurrency, Data, Other
Description:
  unamb contains the "unambiguous choice" operator "unamb", which
  wraps thread racing up in a purely functional, semantically simple
  wrapper.  Originally a part of Reactive, I moved unamb to its own
  package in order to encourage experimentation.

-- Support testing with a pattern from Sean Leather
-- Compilation works, but the executable segfaults:
--   both identity: Segmentation fault/access violation in generated code
-- I have no idea what could be going on there.  The tests work fine
-- in ghci but segfault when compiled via "ghc --make Main" also.

Executable test-unamb
  hs-source-dirs:       src, tests
  main-is:              Tests.hs
  -- Only enable the build-depends here if configured with "-ftest". This
  -- keeps users from having to install QuickCheck 2 in order to use EMGM.
