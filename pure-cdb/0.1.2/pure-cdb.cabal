Synopsis:       Another pure-haskell CDB (Constant Database) implementation
Description:
    A library for reading and writing CDB (Constant Database) files.
    .
    CDB files are immutable key-value stores, designed for extremely fast and memory-efficient
    construction and lookup. They can be as large as 4GB, and at no point in their construction
    or use must all data be loaded into memory. CDB files can contain multiple values for a
    given key. 
    .
    For more information on the CDB file format, please see: <http://cr.yp.to/cdb.html>
    .
    Please note, that there is another pure Haskell CDB library on Hackage:
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hs-cdb>, using memory mapped bytestrings for IO.
    It served as an inspiration for this package.
