synopsis:            Alternative Show class that gives shorter view if possible.
description:         The standard 'Show' class is handy for quickly viewing any Haskell
                     values without having to think about formatting. However, it often
                     produces needlessly clunky string representations, which are difficult
                     to parse by eye. This package offers a drop-in replacement which
                     attempts to keep the representation as short as possible.
