description:         This provides a set of feature macros describing features of @base@ in a semantic way.
                     .
                     See \<</package/base-feature-macros/src/base-feature-macros.h base-feature-macros.h>\> for the set of currently provided macros.
                     .
                     In order to use the CPP header provided by this package, add this package as a dependency to your @.cabal@ file, i.e.
                     .
                     > build-depends: base-feature-macros: >= 0.1 && < 0.2
                     .
                     while making sure that the version specified as lower bound defines the feature-macros your code tests for. This is particularly important as CPP will implicitly treat undefined CPP macros as having the value @0@. See also GNU CPP/CC's @-Wundef@ warning to detect such errors;
                     or starting with GHC 8.2, <https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/master/users-guide/using-warnings.html#ghc-flag--Wcpp-undef -Wcpp-undef> can be used:
                     .
                     > if impl(ghc >= 8.2)
                     >     ghc-options: -Wcpp-undef
                     .
                     Then in your code, you can include and use the @\<base-feature-macros.h\>@ header like so
                     .
                     > module M where
                     >
                     > #include <base-feature-macros.h>
                     >
                     > #if !HAVE_FOLDABLE_TRAVERSABLE_IN_PRELUDE
                     > import Data.Foldable (Foldable (..))
                     > import Prelude       hiding (foldr, foldr1)
                     > #endif
                     > #if !HAVE_MONOID_IN_PRELUDE
                     > import Data.Monoid hiding ((<>))
                     > #endif
                     .
                     This package is inspired by the blogpost
