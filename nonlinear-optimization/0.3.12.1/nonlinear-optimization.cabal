Synopsis:            Various iterative algorithms for optimization of nonlinear functions.
Description:
    This library implements numerical algorithms to optimize
    nonlinear functions.  Optimization means that we try to find
    a minimum of the function.  Currently all algorithms
    guarantee only that local minima will be found, not global
    ones.
    .
    Almost any continuosly differentiable function @f : R^n -> R@
    may be optimized by this library.  Any further restrictions
    are listed in the modules that need them.
    .
    We use the @vector@ package to represent vectors and
    matrices, although it would be possible to use something like
    @hmatrix@ easily.
    .
    Currently only CG_DESCENT method is implemented.
    .
    If you want to use automatic differentiation to avoid hand-writing gradient functions,
    you can use
    <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nonlinear-optimization-ad nonlinear-optimization-ad> package or
    <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/nonlinear-optimization-backprop nonlinear-optimization-backprop> package.
