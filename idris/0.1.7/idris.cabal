Synopsis:       Dependently Typed Functional Programming Language
Description:    Idris is an experimental language with full dependent types.
                Dependent types allow types to be predicated on values,
                meaning that some aspects of a program's behaviour can be
                specified precisely in the type. The language is closely 
		related to Epigram and Agda. There is a tutorial at <http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~eb/Idris/tutorial.html>.
                .
                The aims of the project are:
                .
                * To provide a platform for realistic programming with dependent types.
                By realistic, we mean the ability to interact with the outside world
                and use primitive types and operations. This includes networking,
                file handling, concurrency, etc.
                .
                * To show that full dependent types do not mean we have to abandon
                the functional style we have come to know and love with languages
                like Haskell and OCaml. We aim to show that lightweight dependently typed
                programming means allowing the programmer full access to values in types,
                and letting the type checker do the hard work so you don't have to!
                .
