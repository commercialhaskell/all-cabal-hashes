Synopsis:            Cut files according to a position list
Description:
  Cut a file into chunks according to a position list
  and concatenate the chunks.
  The chunks must not overlap and must be in increasing order.
  .
  Use it this way:
  .
  > cutter positions.csv <datain >dataout
  .
  The file @positions.csv@ must be a comma separated spreadsheet file (CSV),
  where the first column contains the chunk beginnings
  and the second column contains the pause beginnings.
  A pause begins one byte after a chunk ends.
  The other columns are ignored and may contain annotations of the chunks.
  .
  The positions file may also contain line numbers.
  In this case you run the command this way:
  .
  > cutter -l positions.csv <datain >dataout
  .
  Example: remove selected attachments from e-mails in mbox file
  using the @lsmbox@ command from <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mbox-utility>.
