synopsis:            Load any image supported by Juicy.Pixels in your gloss application
description:         Lets you convert any image supported by Juicy.Pixels in a gloss application by converting to gloss' Bitmap representation.
                     Version 0.1.2 just enabled caching (from a frame to the next, and so on) of the images you load, so that they are not recomputed for each frame. Credits go to Jonathan Daugherty for the patch.
