description:
    This library provides data types and combinators that allow you to declare,
    encode, and decode the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies.html IAM JSON policy>
    language with a modicum of safety, minus any extreme type-level features.
    .
    The IAM policy documents can be safely constructed via the provided datatypes
    and mapped, folded, and traversed via the provided instances, combinators,
    and lenses. The resulting structure can then be encoded as a valid IAM JSON
    policy document for using with Amazon IAM and related services.
    .
    The details of what goes into a policy vary for each service, depending on what
    actions the service makes available, what types of resources it contains, and
    so on. When you're writing policies for a specific service, it's helpful to see
    examples of policies for that service. View the
    <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html AWS Services That Work with IAM> documentation for more information.
    .
    See "Amazonka.IAM.Policy" to get started.
