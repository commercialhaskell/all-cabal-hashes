Synopsis:       A DSL for embedded hard realtime applications.
Description:    Atom is a Haskell DSL for designing hard realtime embedded programs.
                Based on conditional term rewriting, atom will compile
                a collection of atomic state transition rules
                to a C program with constant memory use and deterministic execution time.
