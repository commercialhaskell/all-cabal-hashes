synopsis: A DSL for embedded hard realtime applications.

description:
    Atom is a Haskell DSL for designing hard realtime embedded software.
    Based on guarded atomic actions (similar to STM), Atom enables
    highly concurrent programming without the need for mutex locking.

    In addition, Atom performs compile-time task scheduling and generates code
    with deterministic execution time and constant memory use, simplifying the
    process of timing verification and memory consumption in hard realtime applications.

    Without mutex locking and run-time task scheduling, Atom eliminates
    the need and overhead of RTOSs for many embedded applications.
