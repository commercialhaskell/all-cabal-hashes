synopsis:                   various operations on n-ary tuples via GHC.Generics
description:                Some operations on n-ary tuples, including 'uncons', 'cons', etc. This package distinguish itself from other packages
                            on tuple mainly on the the implementation under the cover. It converts Generic datatype into the its representation
                            form, and carries out the operations on there.  The other point is that this package tends to treat non-tuples directly as
                            1-ary, without need of 'OneTuple' or similar intermediate wrapper.
