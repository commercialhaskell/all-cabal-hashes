-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            An efficient random generator monad, based on the Mersenne Twister

-- A longer description of the package.
Description:      Often we need an efficient way to generate high
    quality pseudo-random numbers in Haskell. We have good generators
    themselves (for example, the mersenne-random-pure64 package), however, users
    are often tempted to store the generator in a lazy state monad. This
    causes performance problems.
    .
    This package provides an optimized 'Rand' monad for monadic generation
    of random numbers from a state, with close attention to performance. You
    may have results an order of magnitude or more better than using
    Control.Monad.State to store your generator.
