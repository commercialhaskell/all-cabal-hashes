synopsis:       Windows service applications
description:
  This package provides a partial binding to the Win32 System Services
  API. It makes it easy to write Windows service applications using
  Haskell. _This is the first version that supports both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of GHC._
  .
  The binding is partial. Here are a few ways in which it differs from the
  official API:
  .
  * Only services running within their own process are supported. These are
  processes of the "WIN32_OWN_PROCESS" type.
  .
  * In cases where multiple versions of the same function exist (for
  compatibility), this binding only offers one of them.
  .
  * None of the extended control codes are supported. Handlers you write will
  automatically report this to the operating system when such controls are
  received.
  .
  * Only facilities for writing services are supported; not controlling them.
  .
  Effort has been made to simplify using the API without hiding what is
  happening behind the scenes. Users are encouraged to read Microsoft's
  documentation under 'Dev Center - Desktop > Docs > Desktop app development
  documentation > System Services > Services'. The official example has been
  ported to Haskell. This can be found in the 'examples' directory of the
  source tree.
  .
  /Simple Example and Usage/
  .
  @
  module Main where
  .
  import Control.Concurrent.MVar
  import System.Win32.Services
  .
  main = do
  &#x20;   mStop <- newEmptyMVar
  &#x20;   startServiceCtrlDispatcher \"Test\" 3000 (handler mStop) $ \\_ _ h -> do
  &#x20;       setServiceStatus h running
  &#x20;       takeMVar mStop
  &#x20;       setServiceStatus h stopped
  .
  handler mStop hStatus Stop = do
  &#x20;   setServiceStatus hStatus stopPending
  &#x20;   putMVar mStop ()
  &#x20;   return True
  handler _ _ Interrogate = return True
  handler _ _ _           = return False
  .
  running = ServiceStatus Win32OwnProcess Running [AcceptStop] nO_ERROR 0 0 0
  stopped = ServiceStatus Win32OwnProcess Stopped [] nO_ERROR 0 0 0
  stopPending = ServiceStatus Win32OwnProcess StopPending [AcceptStop] nO_ERROR 0 0 0
  @
  .
  @
  C:\programming\test\>ghc --make -threaded Main.hs
  [1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( Main.hs, Main.o )
  Linking Main.exe ...
  \<linker warnings omitted\>
  C:\\programming\\test\>copy Main.exe c:\\svc\\Test.exe
      1 file(s) copied.
  @
  .
  Execute the following from an elevated command prompt to register the
  service:
  .
  @
  C:\\svc\>sc create Test binPath= c:\\svc\\Test.exe
  [SC] CreateService SUCCESS
  @
  .
  The service can now be started and stopped from the services console.
  .
  Installation Notes:
  .
  Depending on which version of GHC you are using you may also need to add
  a extra-lib-dirs directive. In GHC version 8.4.3 it works out of the box with
  the libadvapi32.a file in ...\\mingw\\x86_64-w64-mingw32\\lib.
  For older version you need to use a version from a Windows SDK. Your
  .cabal file will then need to be modified before installing. A simple `cabal
  install Win32-services` may not work. For example, If you are building on
  Windows 8 64-bit with the Windows 8 SDK the 'extra-lib-dirs' field will need
  to be changed to read as follows:
  .
  @
  Extra-Lib-Dirs: \"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Windows Kits\\\\8.0\\\\Lib\\\\win8\\\\um\\\\x86\"
  @
  .
  If building with stack an option is to set it in stack.yaml.
  For example with the Windows 10 SDK installed with Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017:
  .
  @
  extra-lib-dirs:
  - C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\Lib\\10.0.15063.0\\um\\x64
  @
  .
