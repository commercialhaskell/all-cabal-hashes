synopsis: Automatically generate a function's inverse

description:
    This library deals with computing a function's inverse.
    This is, of course, not possible in general, so the
    applicability of this library comes with some caveats:
    .
      * The function's domain must be enumerable, and
        preferably rather small. We provide a few suggestions
        and utilities for how to enumerate the domain.
      * The function's codomain must belong to the @Eq@ class.
        An @Ord@ or @Hashable@ instance is also nice, to
        accommodate a data structure for efficient lookups.
      * The functions for inverting injections, surjections,
        and bijections require some care to use correctly,
        because the library does not verify these properties.
    .
    The main purpose of this library is to provide documentation
    and convenience. It does not contain a great quantity of code,
    so a user hesitant to incur a dependency on the package might
    well choose only to read and borrow its techniques.
