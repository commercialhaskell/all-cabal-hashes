description:
    This library deals with computing a function’s inverse.
    This is, of course, not possible in general, so the
    applicability of this library comes with some caveats:

      * The function’s domain must be enumerable, and
        preferably rather small. We provide a few suggestions
        and utilities for how to enumerate the domain.
      * The function’s codomain must belong to the @Eq@ class.
        An @Ord@ or @Hashable@ instance is also nice, to
        accommodate a data structure for efficient lookups.
      * The functions for inverting injections, surjections,
        and bijections require some care to use correctly,
        because the library does not verify these properties.

    The main purpose of this library is to provide documentation
    and convenience. It does not contain a great quantity of code,
    so a user hesitant to incur a dependency on the package might
    well choose only to read and borrow its techniques.
