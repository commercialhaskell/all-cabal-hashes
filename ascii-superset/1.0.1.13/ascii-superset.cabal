synopsis: Representing ASCII with refined supersets
category: Data, Text

description:
    This package defines classes which describe what subset of a type
    is valid as ASCII, as well as a type constructor representing a
    value of a superset that is known to be valid ASCII.

    It also defines the Lift class, which provides a polymorphic lift
    operation that can be used to convert characters and strings into
    types that support a larger set of characters.
