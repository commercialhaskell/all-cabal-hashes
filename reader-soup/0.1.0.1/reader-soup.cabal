name:           reader-soup
version:        0.1.0.1
synopsis:       Vinyl-based reader-like monad composition
description:    Packs together a stack of reader-like monads as one single ReaderT of a
                composite state (represented as an array). This permits to represent the
                entire monad stack of an application as one record (in the vinyl sense) of the
                parameters used to run this monad stack, and to add capabilities to that stack
                by just adding a new field to that record. reader-soup is part of the
                porcupine ecosystem. See the README at
                <https://github.com/tweag/porcupine#README.md>
