synopsis:        Provide a simple HTTP client interface by wrapping the wget
                 command line tool.
description:     This provides the simplest interface I could imagine to
                 making HTTP requests. It supports GET and POST parameters.
                 Since it simply wraps the WGET program, there are no
                 library dependencies, and it automatically gets HTTPS.
