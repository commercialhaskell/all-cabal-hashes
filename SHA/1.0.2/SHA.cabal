synopsis: Implementations of the SHA suite of message digest functions
description: This library implements the SHA suite of message digest functions,
             according to NIST FIPS 180-2 (with the SHA-224 addendum). The
             functions have been tested against most of the NIST test vectors
             for the various functions. However, only slight attention has
             been paid to the speed of the functions.
