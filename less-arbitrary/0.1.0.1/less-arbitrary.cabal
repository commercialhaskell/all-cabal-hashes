name:           less-arbitrary
version:        0.1.0.1
synopsis:       Linear time testing with variant of Arbitrary class that always terminates.
description:    Ever found non-terminating Arbitrary instance?
                Ever wondered what would be a runtime cost of particular Arbitrary instance?
                .
                Never let it bother you again:
                  this variant of Arbitrary is automatically generating instances, and allows you to see predictable linear time generators
                  for most types (providing that you have any terminating constructor, that is constructor that does not go deeper into the data structure.)
                .
                Usage: 
                ```
                import Test.LessArbitrary
                .
                data MyDataType = ...
                  deriving (Show, Generic)
                .
                instance LessArbitrary MyDataType
                instance Arbitrary where
                  arbitrary = lessArbitrary
                ```
