description:
    The types from this library are intended to be used with
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides
    mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information, sending requests,
    and receiving responses.
    .
    Lenses are used for constructing and manipulating types,
    due to the depth of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
    de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
    The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
    such as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.
    .
    See "Network.AWS.Glacier" or <https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ the AWS documentation>
    to get started.
