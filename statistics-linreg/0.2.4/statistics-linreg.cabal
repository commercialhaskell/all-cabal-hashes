Name:                statistics-linreg
Version:             0.2.4
Synopsis:            Linear regression between two samples, based on the 'statistics' package.
Description:         Provides functions to perform a linear regression between 2 samples, see the documentation of the linearRegression functions. This library is based on the 'statistics' package.
		     .
		       * 0.2.4: added distribution estimations for standard regression parameters.
		     .
		       * 0.2.3: added robust-fit support.
		     .
		       * 0.2.2: added the Total-Least-Squares version and made some refactoring to eliminate code duplication
		     .
		       * 0.2.1: added the r-squared version and improved the performances.

                     Code sample:
                     .
                     > import qualified Data.Vector.Unboxed as U
                     > 
                     > test :: Int -> IO ()
                     > test k = do
                     >   let n = 10000000
                     >   let a = k*n + 1
                     >   let b = (k+1)*n
                     >   let xs = U.fromList [a..b]
                     >   let ys = U.map (\x -> x*100 + 2000) xs 
                     >   -- thus 100 and 2000 are the alpha and beta we want
                     >   putStrLn "linearRegression:"
                     >   print $ linearRegression xs ys
                     .
                     The r-squared and Total-Least-Squares versions work the same way.
