name:                grouped-list
version:             0.2.2.1
synopsis:            Grouped lists. Equal consecutive elements are grouped.
description:
  Grouped lists work like regular lists, except for two conditions:
  .
  * Grouped lists are always finite. Attempting to construct an infinite
    grouped list will result in an infinite loop.
  .
  * Grouped lists internally represent consecutive equal elements as only
    one, hence the name of /grouped lists/.
  .
  This mean that grouped lists are ideal for cases where the list has many
  repetitions (like @[1,1,1,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,2,2]@, although they might
  present some deficiencies in the absent of repetitions.
