synopsis:       QuickCheck tests with portray-diff
description:    This provides equality assertion functions for QuickCheck that pretty-print
                structural diffs of the values in question, rather than dumping the entire
                alues as part of the counterexamples.  This is useful when comparing very
                large values, since it can otherwise be difficult to tell what changed
                between expected and actual values.
