synopsis:            HTTP client based on io-streams
description:
  An HTTP client, using the Snap Framework's [io-streams](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/io-streams) library to
  handle the streaming IO. The @http-io-streams@ API designed for ease of use when querying web services and dealing with the result as streaming I/O.
  .
  The library is exported in a single module; see "Network.Http.Client"
  for full documentation.
  .
  __NOTE__: This is a fork of [http-streams](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-streams)
  with a lighter dependency footprint which focuses on core HTTP
  functionality and as a consequence doesn't include out-of-the-box
  support for handling JSON data. If you need support for handling JSON
  web-services, you should use the original @http-streams@ package instead of
  this package.
