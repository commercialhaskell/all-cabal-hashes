synopsis: Automatically convert Generic instances to and from church representations
description: This package provides a type 'ChurchRep' to generically construct 
             the type of the church representation.

             Additionally, it provides a type class 'Church' which contains
             a pair of functions for mapping back and forth between the two
             representations.
             Both the @ChurchRep@ and the @Church@ instance are be automatically constructed
             for all types with a @Generic@ instance.

             Based on code by Danny Gratzer.
