name:           failable
version:        1.2.1.0
synopsis:       A 'Failable' error monad class to unify failure across monads that can fail
description:    This library contains a 'Failable' error monad class to unify failure across monads and transformers most commonly used to implement pipelines that can fail and does so in a simple nonsense way by providing the means of signaling a computation "failure" while striving to keep the failure behaviour consistent with the actual definition of the monad/transformer. Please refer to the README file for a more elaborate description and some examples.
