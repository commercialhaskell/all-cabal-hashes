name:                bisc
version:             0.4.1.0
synopsis:            A small tool that clears cookies (and more).
description:         

  Websites can store unwanted data using all sorts of methods: besides
  the usual cookies, there are also the local and session storage, the
  IndexedDB API and more caches as well.

  Bisc will try to go through each of them and remove all information from
  websites that are not explicitly allowed (ie. a whitelist of domains).
  It was created for qutebrowser, but it actually supports the storage
  format used by Chromium-based browsers, which (sadly) means almost
  every one nowadays.
