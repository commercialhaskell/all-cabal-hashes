name:            parametric-functor
version:         0.1.1.0
synopsis:        A known-parametric Functor typeclass
description:
  As Oleg Grenrus [argued](http://oleg.fi/gists/posts/2019-07-31-fmap-coerce-coerce.html) in 2019,
  'Functor's should be parametric, and in particular should:

    - Satisfy @fmap coerce@ = @coerce@
    - Have a @∀ a b. Coercible a b ⇒ Coercible (f a) (f b)@ super-constraint

  Until this change gets adopted in @base@, this package can be used for a variant of 'Functor'
  which satisfies these requirements.
