synopsis:       Hashing and checking of passwords
description:
    A library providing functionality for working with plain-text and hashed passwords
    with different types of algorithms.
    .
    == API
    .
    Every supported hashing algorithm has its own module (e.g. "Data.Password.Bcrypt")
    which exports its own @hashPassword@ and @checkPassword@ functions, as well as all the
    types and functions in this module. If you are not sure about the specifics of an
    algorithm you want to use, you can rest assured that by using the @hashPassword@ function
    of the respective algorithm you are not making any big mistakes, security-wise.
    .
    Of course, if you know what you're doing and you want more fine-grained control
    over the hashing function, you can adjust it using the @hashPasswordWithParams@
    function of the respective algorithm.
    .
    == Algorithms
    .
    Generally, the most "secure" algorithm is believed to be @Argon2@, then @scrypt@,
    then @bcrypt@, and lastly @PBKDF2@.
    @bcrypt@ and @PBKDF2@ are the most established algorithms, so they have been tried and
    tested, though they both lack a memory cost, and therefore have a greater vulnerability
    to specialized hardware attacks.
    .
    When choosing an algorithm, and you have no idea which to pick, just go for @bcrypt@ if
    your password does not need the highest security possible.
    It's still a fine way for hashing passwords, and the cost is easily adjustable if needed.
    If your needs do require stronger protection, you should find someone who can advise you
    on this topic. (And if you're already knowledgeable enough, you know what to do)
