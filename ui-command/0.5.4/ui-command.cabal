Synopsis:            A framework for friendly commandline programs
Description:         This is a framework for creating commandline applications. It
         provides various features which give a polished feel to your
         application.
         .
                     It is designed to encourage you to provide clear documentation
         and working examples. It implements default ''help''
         and ''man'' commands for your application, which will layout help
         text and generate Unix-style man pages.
         .
                     It provides special handling for applications of the form
         ''program command args'', the style of interaction common in revision
         control systems. It will dispatch to handler functions that you
         provide for each command, and also provide command-specific
         help to the user.
