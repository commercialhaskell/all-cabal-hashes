synopsis:           A new, simple, composable concurrency abstraction.
description:        A monad @m@ is said to allow scheduling if you can pass a number of actions @m a@ to it,
                    and those can be executed at the same time concurrently.
                    You can observe the result of the actions after some time:
                    Some actions will complete first, and the results of these are returned then as a list @'NonEmpty' a@.
                    Other actions are still running, and for these you will receive continuations of type @m a@,
                    which you can further run or schedule to completion as you like.
