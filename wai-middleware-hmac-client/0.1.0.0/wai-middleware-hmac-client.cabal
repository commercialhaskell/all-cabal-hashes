description:
   .
   Ready to use client module for wai-middleware-hmac. This module is
   built on http-client but is in the Wai namespace since the protocol
   is somewhat specific. Although this implementation does follow the
   RFC as closely as possible as well as Amazon AWS's implementation.
   Howeber, since nothing is formally specified these modules are
   specifically built for each other Because of this, we also try to
   maintain a slim dependency profile.  Because of the compatibility
   with http-client you can still build into a streaming module if
   needed
