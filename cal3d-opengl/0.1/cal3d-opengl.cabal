synopsis: OpenGL rendering for the Cal3D animation library
description: 
  Connects the Cal3D animation library to OpenGL.
  Cal3D is a skeletal-based animation library written in C++.
  By itself, it does not rendering, but provides hooks 
  so that any graphics API can render the model.
  This specializes the hooks for OpenGL.
  See also cal3d, cal3d-examples.
