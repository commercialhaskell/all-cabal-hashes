synopsis:            Diff algorithm in pure Haskell
description:         Implementation of the standard diff algorithm, and utilities for pretty printing.  Time complexity is proportional to N (input length) & D (number of differences).  Space complexity is D^2.  Includes utilities for pretty printing.
