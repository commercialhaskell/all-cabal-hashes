synopsis:            Logging bridge between Yesod and Katip
description:         A library of ytl-style site transformers for adding Katip
                     logging functionality to Yesod monads, as well as capturing
                     and redirectly Yesod-style logging to Katip scribes.
                     .
                     This package supports two workflows:
                     .
                     * Taking an existing Yesod website and making its logs also
                       go to Katip, without changing any of the handlers, by
                       wrapping the foundation site in a site transformer.
                     .
                     * Using the Katip logging API inside Yesod handlers and
                       widgets through constraints on the foundation site. In
                       this workflow, the site transformers are an easy way to
                       give an existing foundation site Katip functionality and
                       sensible default behaviours.
