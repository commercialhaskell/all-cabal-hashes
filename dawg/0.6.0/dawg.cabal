synopsis:           Directed acyclic word graphs
description:
    The library implements /directed acyclic word graphs/ (DAWGs) internaly
    represented as /minimal acyclic deterministic finite-state automata/.
    .
    The "Data.DAWG" module provides fast insert and delete operations which
    can be used to build the automaton on-the-fly.
    Automaton from the "Data.DAWG.Frozen" module is ,,immutable'', but it
    has lower memory footprint and provides perfect hashing functionality.
