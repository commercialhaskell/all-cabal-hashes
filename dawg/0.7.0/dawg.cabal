version:            0.7.0
synopsis:           Directed acyclic word graphs
description:
    The library implements /directed acyclic word graphs/ (DAWGs) internaly
    represented as /minimal acyclic deterministic finite-state automata/.
    .
    The "Data.DAWG" module provides fast insert and delete operations which
    can be used to build the automaton on-the-fly.
    The automaton from the "Data.DAWG.Static" module has lower memory
    footprint and provides static hashing functionality.
