Synopsis:            Lift control operations like exception catching through monad transformers
Description:
  This package defines @MonadPeelIO@, a subset of @MonadIO@ into which
  generic control operations such as @catch@ can be lifted from @IO@.
  Instances are based on monad transformers in @MonadTransPeel@, which
  includes all standard monad transformers in the @transformers@
  library except @ContT@.  For convenience, it provides a wrapped
  version of Control.Exception with types generalized from @IO@ to all
  monads in @MonadPeelIO@.
