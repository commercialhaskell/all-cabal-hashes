Synopsis:            Common quickcheck instances
Description:         QuickCheck instances.
                     .
                     The goal is to supply QuickCheck instances for
                     types provided by the Haskell Platform.
                     .
                     Since all of these instances are provided as
                     orphans, I recommend that you do not use this library
                     within another library module, so that you don't
                     impose these instances on down-stream consumers of
                     your code.
                     .
