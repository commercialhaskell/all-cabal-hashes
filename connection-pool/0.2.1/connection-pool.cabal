name:                   connection-pool
version:                0.2.1
synopsis:
  Connection pool built on top of resource-pool and streaming-commons.
description:
  Connection poll is a family specialised resource pools. Currently package
  provides two variants:
  .
  1. pool for TCP client connections,
  .
  2. and pool for UNIX Sockets client connections.
  .
  In addition it can be used to build your own connection pool using provided
  primitives.
  .
  This package is built on top of
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/resource-pool resource-pool> and
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming-commons streaming-commons>.
  The later allows us to use
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit-extra conduit-extra> package
  for implementation of TCP or UNIX Sockets clients.
  .
  For examples and other details see documentation in "Data.ConnectionPool"
  module.

      -- Changes in streaming-commons that broke this package:
      --
      -- * Version 0.1.6 introduced appCloseConnection' field of AppData.
      -- * Version 0.1.12 introduced appRawSocket' field of AppData.
      -- * Version 0.1.13 extended ClientSettings with clientReadBufferSize
      --   field and ClientSettingsUnix with clientReadBufferSizeUnix field.
      --   See https://github.com/fpco/streaming-commons/pull/23 for details.
      -- * Version 0.1.14 exports HasReadBufferSize type class and it also has
      --   instance for ClientSettingsUnix. See
