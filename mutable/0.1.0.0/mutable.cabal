name:           mutable
version:        0.1.0.0
synopsis:       Automatic piecewise-mutable references for your types
description:    Associate and generate "piecewise-mutable" versions for your composite data
                types.  Think of it like a "generalized MVector for all ADTs".
                .
                Useful for a situation where you have a record with many fields (or many nested
                records) that you want to use for efficient mutable in-place algorithms.  This
                library lets you do efficient "piecewise" mutations (operations that only edit
                one field), and also efficient entire-datatype copies/updates, as well, in many
                cases.
                .
                See <https://mutable.jle.im> for official introduction and documentation,
                or jump right in by importing "Data.Mutable".
