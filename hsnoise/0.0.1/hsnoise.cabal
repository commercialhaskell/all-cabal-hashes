synopsis:           A coherent 3d noise library.

description:        A coherent 3d noise library loosely based on libnoise.  Currently has an
                    implementation of perlin noise.  Will eventually support other noise
                    types as well as noise function combinations.
                    .
                    Code examples included in package.
                    .
