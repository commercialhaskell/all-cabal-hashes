synopsis:
  Types and optics for manipulating Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)

description:
  This library provides a type representing [Amazon Resource Names
  (ARNs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html),
  and parsing/unparsing functions for them. The provided optics make
  it very convenient to rewrite parts of ARNs.
  .
  Start reading at the "Network.AWS.ARN" module, which defines the
  core data type and includes some examples.
  .
  The @ARN@ type is not designed to be a 100% correct-by-construction
  representation of only valid ARNs; it is designed to be a
  lightweight way to destructure and reassemble ARNs to be used in
  place of string munging.
  .
  The library aims to provide additional parsers for destructuring the
  "resource" part of an ARN, but many are missing right now. PRs to
  add this support for more AWS resource types are __especially__
  welcome.
