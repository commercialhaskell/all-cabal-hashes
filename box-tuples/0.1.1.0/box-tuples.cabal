name:                box-tuples
version:             0.1.1.0
synopsis:            A hack to use GHC.Prim primitives in GHCi
description:         As of now, the GHCi interactive runtime is incapable of working on unboxed
                     tuples. In particular, it is unable to fully apply any function returning an
                     unboxed tuple, create a function that takes a non-nullary unboxed tuple as
                     argument, or pass a non-nullary tuple to some other function. The usual
                     solution is to enable object code generation with @-fobject-code@. This
                     package serves as a workaround for the cases where @-fobject-code@ is
                     undesiable.
