description:
   We represent the target language itself as an ideal monad supplied by the
   user, and provide a 'Scope' monad transformer for introducing bound variables
   in user supplied terms. Users supply a 'Monad' and 'Traversable' instance,
   and we traverse to find free variables, and use the Monad to perform
   substitution that avoids bound variables.
   .
   An untyped lambda calculus:
   .
   > import Bound
   > import Prelude.Extras
   .
   > infixl 9 :@
   > data Exp a = V a | Exp a :@ Exp a | Lam (Scope () Exp a)
   >  deriving (Eq,Ord,Show,Read,Functor,Foldable,Traversable)
   .
   > instance Eq1 Exp   where (==#)      = (==)
   > instance Ord1 Exp  where compare1   = compare
   > instance Show1 Exp where showsPrec1 = showsPrec
   > instance Read1 Exp where readsPrec1 = readsPrec
   > instance Applicative Exp where pure = V; (<*>) = ap
   .
   > instance Monad Exp where
   >   return = V
   >   V a      >>= f = f a
   >   (x :@ y) >>= f = (x >>= f) :@ (y >>= f)
   >   Lam e    >>= f = Lam (e >>>= f)
   >
   > lam :: Eq a => a -> Exp a -> Exp a
   > lam v b = Lam (abstract1 v b)
   .
   > whnf :: Exp a -> Exp a
   > whnf (f :@ a) = case whnf f of
   >   Lam b -> whnf (instantiate1 a b)
   >   f'    -> f' :@ a
   > whnf e = e
   .
   The classes from Prelude.Extras are used to facilitate the automatic deriving
   of 'Eq', 'Ord', 'Show', and 'Read' in the presence of polymorphic recursion
   used inside 'Scope'.
   .
   The goal of this package is to make it as easy as possible to deal with name
   binding without forcing an awkward monadic style on the user.
   .
   With generalized de Bruijn term you can 'lift' whole trees instead of just
   applying 'succ' to individual variables, weakening the all variables bound
   by a scope. and by giving binders more structure we can permit easy
   simultaneous substitution.
   .
   The approach was first elaborated upon by Richard Bird and Ross Patterson
   in \"de Bruijn notation as a nested data type\", available from
   <http://www.cs.uwyo.edu/~jlc/courses/5000_fall_08/debruijn_as_nested_datatype.pdf>
   .
   However, the combinators they used required higher rank types. Here we
   demonstrate that the higher rank @gfold@ combinator they used isn't necessary
   to build the monad and use a monad transformer to encapsulate the novel
   recursion pattern in their generalized de Bruijn representation. It is named
   'Scope' to match up with the terminology and usage pattern from Conor McBride
   and James McKinna's \"I am not a number: I am a free variable\", available
   from <http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~james/RESEARCH/notanum.pdf>, but since
   the set of variables is visible in the type, we can provide stronger type
   safety guarantees.
   .
   There are longer examples in the @examples/@ folder:
   .
   <https://github.com/ekmett/bound/tree/master/examples>
   .
   (1) /Simple.hs/ provides an untyped lambda calculus with recursive let
     bindings and includes an evaluator for the untyped lambda calculus and a
     longer example taken from Lennart Augustsson's "λ-calculus cooked four
     ways" available from <http://www.augustsson.net/Darcs/Lambda/top.pdf>
   .
   2. /Derived.hs/ shows how much of the API can be automated with
      DeriveTraversable and adds combinators for building binders that support
      pattern matching.
   .
   3. /Overkill.hs/ provides very strongly typed pattern matching many modern
     language extensions, including polymorphic kinds to ensure type safety.
     In general, the approach taken by Derived seems to deliver a better power
     to weight ratio.
