Description:         A lightweight web framework, with type safe routes, based on invertible-syntax, and i18n support.
    .
        The features of this web framework:
    .
        *   Type safe routes, specify url-handler mapping in one place.
    .
        *   Simple yet elegant handler via type class.
    .
        *   Flexible template system, utilize exsisting libraries such as Blaze-Html and Hastache.
    .
        *   Easy i18n
    .
