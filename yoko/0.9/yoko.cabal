synopsis: Generic Programming with Disbanded Data Types

description:
  Based off of the paper \"A Pattern for Almost Homomorphic Functions\"
  at <http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~nfrisby/frisby-wgp-2012.pdf>, presented at the
  Workshop on Generic Programming 2012. Also, my
  dissertation <http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~nfrisby/frisby-dissertation.pdf>
  .
  @yoko@ views a nominal datatype as a /band/ of constructors, each
  a nominal type in its own right. Such datatypes can be disbanded via the
  @disband@ function into an anonymous sum of nominal constructors, and vice
  versa via the @band@ function. This library uses extensive type-level
  programming to enrich its @instant-generics@ foundation with capabilities
  derived from the constructor-centric perspective.
  .
  For example, consider the following /nominal datatype/.
  .
  @
    data Beatles = John ... | Paul ... | George ... | Ringo ...
  @
  .
  This type can of course be understood as a sum of the individual
  /fields types/.
  .
  @
    data John   = John   ...
    data Paul   = Paul   ...
    data George = George ...
    data Ringo  = Ringo  ...
  @
  .
  @yoko@'s conceptual foundations start there. In particular, this allows a
  constructor, say @John@, to be used independently of its original range type
  and sibling constructors.
  .
  As a generic programming library, @yoko@ extends @instant-generics@ with
  support for constructor-centric generic programming. The
  @Examples\/LambdaLift\/LambdaLift.hs@ file distributed with the @yoko@ source
  demonstrates defining a lambda-lifting conversion between the two types
  @ULC@, which has lambdas, and @Prog@, which has top-level function
  declarations instead.
  .
  @
    data ULC = Lam Type ULC | Var Int | Let [Decl] ULC | App ULC ULC
  .
    data Decl = Decl Type ULC
  .
  .
  .
    data Prog = Prog [FunDec] TLF
    type FunDec = ([Type], [Type], Type, TLF)
  .
    data TLF = Top Int [Occ] | Occ Occ | App TLF TLF
    data Occ = Par Int | Env Int
  @
  .
  These types are defined in separate modules, since they have constructors
  with the same name. Indeed, the fact that they having matching constructors
  named @App@ is crucial for @yoko@'s automatic conversion from @ULC@'s @App@
  to @TLF@'s @App@. As written, the generic lambda-lifter would continue to
  work for any new @ULC@ constructors (e.g. syntax for tuples or mutable
  references) as long as constructors with the same names and analogous fields
  were added to @TLF@ and the semantics of those constructors doesn't involve
  binding. This default /generic/ behavior of the lambda-lifter is specified in
  about ten lines of user code.
  .
  The non-generic code is much more complicated. This is intentional: I wanted
  to show that sometimes shoehorning an algorithm into the requisite type (/ie/
  @a -> m a'@) can be difficult and require subtleties like backwards state.
  .
  Existing generic libraries don't use constructor names to the degree that
  @yoko@ does, and so cannot accomodate generic /conversions/ as well.
