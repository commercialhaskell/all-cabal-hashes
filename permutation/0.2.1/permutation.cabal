name:            permutation
version:         0.2.1
homepage:        http://stat.stanford.edu/~patperry/code/permutation
synopsis:        A library for representing and applying permutations.
description:
    This library includes data types for storing permutations.  It
    implements pure and impure types, the latter of which can be modified
    in-place.  The main utility of the library is converting between
    the linear representation of a permutation and a sequence of swaps.
    This allows, for instance, applying a permutation or its inverse
    to an array with O(1) memory use.
    .
    Much of the interface for the library is based on the permutation 
    functions in the GNU Scientific Library (GSL).
