name:            permutation

synopsis:        A library for permutations and combinations.
description:
    This library includes data types for storing permutations and
    combinations.  It implements pure and impure types, the latter of
    which can be modified in-place.  The library uses aggressive
    inlining and MutableByteArray#s internally, so it is very
    efficient.
    .
    The main utility of the library is converting between the linear
    representation of a permutation and a sequence of swaps.  This 
    allows, for instance, applying a permutation or its inverse
    to an array with O(1) memory use.
    .
    Much of the interface for the library is based on the permutation 
    and combination functions in the GNU Scientific Library (GSL).
