Synopsis:         Process MIDI events via reactive-banana and JACK
Description:
   MIDI is the Musical Instrument Digital Interface,
   JACK is the JACK Audio Connection Kit.
   This package allows to manipulate a sequence of MIDI events via JACK.
   It is intended to be plugged as a playing assistant
   between a MIDI input device
   (e.g. a keyboard or a controller bank)
   and a MIDI controlled synthesizer
   (e.g. a software synthesizer or an external synthesizer).
   For software synthesizers see the Haskell packages
   @synthesizer-alsa@, @synthesizer-llvm@, @supercollider-midi@,
   @hsc3@, @YampaSynth@
   or the C packages @fluidsynth@ and @Timidity@.
   .
   Applications include:
   Remapping of channels, controller, instruments, keys,
   Keyboard splitting, Conversion from notes to controllers, Latch mode,
   Convert parallel chords to serial patterns,
   Automated change of MIDI controllers,
   Delay and echo.
   .
   It is intended that you write programs for MIDI stream manipulation.
   It is not intended to provide an executable program
   with all the functionality available
   in a custom programming interface.
   It is most fun to play with the stream editors in GHCi.
   However we provide an example module that demonstrates various effects.
