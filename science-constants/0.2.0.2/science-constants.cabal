description:
  This package provides constants and conversion factors commonly used in
  mathematics and physical sciences. The motivation is to make it easier
  to use ghci for quick scientific calculations [without the need to
  search for the constant values over the internet.] To make it even
  friendlier, if multiple conventional names of a constant exist, they all
  are provided by this package. Wherever possible, TeX-style named
  constants are also provided.
  .
  This package utilizes untyped values (i.e. untyped in terms of
  @unittyped@, @dimensional@, and similar libraries); and unless otherwise
  specified, the constants are in SI units: mass in kilograms, length in
  meters, etc.
  .
  Due to floating-point calculation errors and to improve accuracy, the
  package internally uses exact values even in cases where constants can
  be mathematically derived one from another.
  .
  Most of the constants values were taken from the Fundamental Constants
  Data Center of the NIST Physical Measurement Laboratory (by Barry N.
  Taylor of the Data Center in close collaboration with Peter J. Mohr of
  the Physical Measurement Laboratory's Atomic Physics Division.)
