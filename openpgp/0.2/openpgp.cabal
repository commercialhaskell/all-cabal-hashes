description:
        This is an OpenPGP library inspired by my work on OpenPGP libraries in
        Ruby <https://github.com/singpolyma/openpgp>,
        PHP <http://github.com/singpolyma/openpgp-php>,
        and Python <https://github.com/singpolyma/OpenPGP-Python>.
        .
        It defines types to represent OpenPGP messages as a series of packets
        and then defines instances of Data.Binary for each to facilitate
        encoding/decoding.
        .
        There is also a wrapper around <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Crypto>
        that currently does fingerprint generation, signature generation, and
        signature verification (for RSA keys only).
        .
        It is intended that you use qualified imports with this library.  If importing
        both modules, something like this will do:
        .
        > import qualified Data.OpenPGP as OpenPGP
        > import qualified Data.OpenPGP.Crypto as OpenPGP
