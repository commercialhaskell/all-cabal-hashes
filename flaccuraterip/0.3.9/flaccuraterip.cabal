Synopsis:       Verify FLAC files ripped form CD using AccurateRip™
Description:

  /flAccurateRip/ is a command line tool to verify the accuracy of FLAC files
  ripped from CD, using the information contained in the AccurateRip™ database
  about other rips of the same CD.
  .
  Usage: suppose you ripped a CD into @track01.flac@, @track02.flac@, ...,
  @trackNN.flac@. Open a shell in the directory containing the FLAC files, and
  run:
  .
  >$ flaccuraterip track01.flac track02.flac ... trackNN.flac
  .
  If a pressing of this CD is present in the AccurateRip™ database,
  @flaccuraterip@ will output the ripping accuracy for each track. If the CD was
  ripped without setting the drive offset, you should use the flag
  @--with-sample-offset=N@, where N is the offset indicated in
  <http://accuraterip.com/driveoffsets.htm> for your drive.
