Cabal-Version: >= 1.6
Name:          AC-Vector
Version:       2.3.2
x-revision: 1
Stability:     Experimental
Synopsis:      Efficient geometric vectors and transformations.

Description:

  This Haskell library implements several small vectors types
  with @Double@ fields, with seperate types for each size of
  vector, and a type class for handling vectors generally.
  (Note that although this package is listed in the \"graphics\"
  category, the package itself has no graphics facilities. It
  just contains data structures that are useful for graphics
  work.)
  .
  Changes:
  .
  * Fixed a stupid bug in @union@. Until now, the function could
    sometimes return gibberish answers. Hopefully this is now fixed.
