Stability:     Experimental
Synopsis:      Efficient geometric vectors and transformations.

Description:

  This Haskell library implements several small vectors types
  with @Double@ fields, with seperate types for each size of
  vector, and a type class for handling vectors generally.

  Existing API has been rearranged. Now supports 4D vectors
  and linear transformations.
