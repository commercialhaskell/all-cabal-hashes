Name:          AC-Vector
Version:       2.1.0
x-revision: 1
Stability:     Experimental
Synopsis:      Efficient geometric vectors and transformations.

Description:

  This Haskell library implements several small vectors types
  with @Double@ fields, with seperate types for each size of
  vector, and a type class for handling vectors generally.

  Now includes \"bounding box\" types, useful for graphical work.
  (Note that this package itself has no graphics facilities as
  such. It just provides data structures useful for graphics.)
