-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            A generic, derivable, haskell pretty printer.

-- A longer description of the package.
Description: GenericPretty is a haskell library that provides support for automatic
	derivation of pretty printing functions on user defined data types.
	The Outputable library is used underneath, the work is done over SDoc types.
	.	
	The output provided by the library functions is identical to that of Prelude.show, 
	except it has extra whitespace.
	.	
	This requires the use of the new GHC.Generics features: <http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Generics>.
	These seem to be present in the GHC HEAD development snapshots >= 7.1.20110601.
	.
	For more info and examples of usage please see the README file and the API.
