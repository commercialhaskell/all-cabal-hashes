    Amazon DynamoDB Streams

    This is the Amazon DynamoDB Streams API Reference. This guide describes
    the low-level API actions for accessing streams and processing stream
    records. For information about application development with DynamoDB
    Streams, see the
    <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide//Streams.html Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide>.

    Note that this document is intended for use with the following DynamoDB
    documentation:

    -   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide>

    -   <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/ Amazon DynamoDB API Reference>

    The following are short descriptions of each low-level DynamoDB Streams
    API action, organized by function.

    -   /DescribeStream/ - Returns detailed information about a particular
        stream.

    -   /GetRecords/ - Retrieves the stream records from within a shard.

    -   /GetShardIterator/ - Returns information on how to retrieve the
        streams record from a shard with a given shard ID.

    -   /ListStreams/ - Returns a list of all the streams associated with
        the current AWS account and endpoint.
    .
    The types from this library are intended to be used with
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides
    mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.
    .
    Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
    This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
    de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
    The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
    such as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.
    .
    See "Network.AWS.DynamoDBStreams" and the <http://dynamodb-preview.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/docs/streams-api/Welcome.html AWS API Reference>
    to get started.
