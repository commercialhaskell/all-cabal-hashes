    Amazon DynamoDB

    Amazon DynamoDB Streams provides API actions for accessing streams and processing stream records. To learn more about application development with Streams, see <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html Capturing Table Activity with DynamoDB Streams> in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

    The following are short descriptions of each low-level DynamoDB Streams action:

    -   /DescribeStream/ - Returns detailed information about a particular stream.

    -   /GetRecords/ - Retrieves the stream records from within a shard.

    -   /GetShardIterator/ - Returns information on how to retrieve the streams record from a shard with a given shard ID.

    -   /ListStreams/ - Returns a list of all the streams associated with the current AWS account and endpoint.
    .
    The types from this library are intended to be used with
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides
    mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.
    .
    Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
    This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
    de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
    The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
    such as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.
    .
    See "Network.AWS.DynamoDBStreams" or <https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ the AWS Documentation>
    to get started.
