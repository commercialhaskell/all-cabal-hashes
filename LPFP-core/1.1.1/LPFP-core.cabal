name:           LPFP-core
version:        1.1.1
synopsis:       Code for the book Learn Physics with Functional Programming
description:    Haskell code to help the user learn mechanics of one particle,
                mechanics of multiple interacting particles, and electromagnetic theory.
                LPFP-core elides all of the graphics dependencies of LPFP,
                so it has a much better chance of building without problems.
