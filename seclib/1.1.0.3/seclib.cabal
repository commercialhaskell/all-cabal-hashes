description:
  This package presents a static library to enforce
  /Information-Flow Control/ (IFC) in Haskell.
  IFC allows untrusted code to manipulate sensitive
  data (i.e., secret information), while preserving its confidentiality.

  .

  To illustrate the use case scenario for /SecLib/, let us consider two Haskell
  programmers , Alice and Bob, who do not trust each other. Image that Alice
  wishes to use Bob's code to check the strength of Alice's sensitive passwords.
  Clearly, Alice is concern that the passwords could be leaked if they are run
  with Bob's code. How could Alice be sure that Bob's code will preserve the
  confidentiality of Alice's password? One option is to do code review---a
  time consuming approach. Instead, Alice demands that Bob's code uses the
  security monads provided by this library (i.e., 'Sec' and 'SecIO'). Now, Alice
  only requires, by using the type-system, that Bob's code is written using such
  monads. Importantly, Alice needs to use Safe Haskell to compile Bob's
  untrusted code using the flags @-XSafe@. This package provides the files
  @Alice.hs@ and @Bob.hs@. The former calls into functions provided by the
  latter and the library guarantees that secrets are not unintentionally or
  maliciously leaked.

  .

  The library is a modern and simplified version (updated to exploit the last
  GHC type-system features) of the work presented in
  /A Library for Light-weight Information-Flow Security in Haskell/ by
  Alejandro Russo, Koen Claessen and
  John Hughes. In Proc. of the ACM SIGPLAN 2008 Haskell Symposium. With respect
  to the version 1.0.0.0, this version has less side-effectful features (e.g.,
  no secure file handlers and sockets) as well as declassification combinators. However,
  it presents a simpler and more intuitive interface which can be easily
  extended to cover a rich-set of side-effects.
