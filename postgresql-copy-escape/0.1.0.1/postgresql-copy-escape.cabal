synopsis:           Format data to feed to a PostgreSQL COPY FROM statement
description:
    In PostgreSQL, the @COPY@ statement [1] provides a fast way to perform bulk
    insertion and retrieval.  To use @COPY ... FROM@ for bulk insertion, the
    data must first be converted to a special CSV-like format.
    .
    This package provides basic support for converting data to the format
    needed by @COPY ... FROM@.  However, it does not provide the inverse
    operation (namely, reading data produced by @COPY ... TO@), nor does it
    support formatting customizations (what delimiter to use, how to represent
    NULL, etc.).
    .
