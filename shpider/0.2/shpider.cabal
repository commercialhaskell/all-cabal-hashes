Name:               shpider 
Version:            0.2
Synopsis:           Web automation library in Haskell.
Description:
    Shpider is a web automation library for Haskell.   It allows you to quickly
    write crawlers, and for simple cases ( like following links ) even without
    reading the page source.
    .
    It has useful features such as turning relative links from a page into
    absolute links, options to authorize transactions only on a given domain,
    and the option to only download html documents.
    .
    It also provides a nice syntax for filling out forms.
    .
    An example:
    .
    > runShpider $ do
    >      download "http://apage.com"
    >      theForm : _ <- getFormsByAction "http://anotherpage.com"
    >      sendForm $ fillOutForm theForm $ pairs $ do
    >            "occupation" =: "unemployed Haskell programmer"
    >            "location" =: "mother's house"
    .
