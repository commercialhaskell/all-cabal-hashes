synopsis:        Defunctionalization helpers: core definitions
description:
  The package @defun@ provides defunctionalization helpers, most importantly
  type family 'DeFun.Core.App' allowing to write higher-order type families.
  The @singletons@ package also has its own type family @Apply@,
  but the machinery is tied to the @Sing@ / singletons.
  .
  In particular, the @Lam@ counterpart @SLambda@ is specialized to @Sing@ arguments.
  The @defun@'s @Lam@ is however fully general, so you can use your own singletons
  or (importantly) singleton-like arguments.
  .
  The package provides few defunctionalized functions, and their term-level
  variants can be found in @defun-bool@ and @defun-sop@ packages,
  which use @SBool@ and @NP@ data types from @singletons-bool@ and @sop-core@
  packages respectively.
