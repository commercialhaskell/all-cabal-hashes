synopsis:

  Extensible, type-safe formatting with scanf- and printf-like functions

description:

  /Warning:/ This version of the package is very experimental and the interface
  may change in later versions. I am seeking comments to improve it.
  .
  This package is composed of two functions for formatted conversion between
  strings and typed values. Each is defined as a type-indexed function using a
  type class with multiple parameters and functional dependencies along with
  format descriptors.
  .
  "Text.XFormat.Read" allows one to parse values from a formatted string. Its
  functionality is similar to the C @scanf@ function. Unlike @scanf@, however,
  the format descriptor is well-typed, ensuring that the output type is
  statically known.
  .
  "Text.XFormat.Show" allows one to print values to a formatted string. Its
  functionality is similar to the C @printf@ function. Unlike @printf@, however,
  the format descriptor is well-typed, ensuring that the variable number
  arguments are statically known.
  .
  These functions can be easily extended to support new formats and new types.
  Extension is simple: define a format descriptor and an instance of the
  appropriate class.
