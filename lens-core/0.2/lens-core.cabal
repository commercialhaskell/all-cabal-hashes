cabal-version: 2.2
name: lens-core
version: 0.2
synopsis: A placeholder for a future lens core package.
description: 
  Cabal 2.2 allows reexported modules, which will eventually
  allow us to consider splitting @lens@ into smaller pieces.
  .
  Cabal 3.4 allows multiple public sub-libraries in a package
  Which may be a better plan, to avoid hackage namespace pollution.
  .
  I'm claiming this name to avoid rampant namespace confusion
  between @lens:core@ and @lens-core@ in the latter scenario and
  to allow progress on the former scenario.
  .
  For now, use @lens@.
