synopsis:            Finds values satisfying a lazy predicate
description:         
  This library can be used as a property based testing driver, and more
  generally to find values satisfying a predicate (@a -> Bool@). This 
  is done by a size bounded search, and it uses the laziness of the 
  predicate to speed up the search by avoiding isomorphic values. 
  .
  This is similar to "LazySmallCheck" but uses size instead of depth 
  and a faster algorithm.
