synopsis:        A wrapper around UnexceptionalIO using monad transformers
description:
        UnexceptionalIO provides a basic type to witness having caught all
        exceptions you can safely handle.  This library builds on that with
        transformers like ExceptT to provide a more ergonomic tool for many
        cases.
        .
        It is intended that you use qualified imports with this library.
