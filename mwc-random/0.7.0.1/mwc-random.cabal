x-revision: 1
synopsis:       Fast, high quality pseudo random number generation
description:
  This package contains code for generating high quality random
  numbers that follow either a uniform or normal distribution.  The
  generated numbers are suitable for use in statistical applications.
  .
  The uniform PRNG uses Marsaglia's MWC256 (also known as MWC8222)
  multiply-with-carry generator, which has a period of 2^8222 and
  fares well in tests of randomness.  It is also extremely fast,
  between 2 and 3 times faster than the Mersenne Twister.
  .
  Compared to the mersenne-random package, this package has a more
  convenient API, is faster, and supports more statistical
  distributions.
