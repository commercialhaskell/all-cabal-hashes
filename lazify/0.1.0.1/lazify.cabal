version:             0.1.0.1
synopsis:            A simple utility for lazy record matching
description:
    .
    Since early Haskell history, it's been convenient to make values
    stricter using `seq`. Making them lazier has always been a bit
    of a chore. This package offers tools for doing so.

    .
    For an idiomatic classy approach with generic defaults, use
    "Data.Lazify". To just go with whatever the generics say
    (aside from overlapping instances), use "Data.Lazify.Generic".
