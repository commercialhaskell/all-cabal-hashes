-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:            Parser for OFX data

-- A longer description of the package.
description:

  A parser for Open Financial Exchange (OFX) financial data. This
  handles OFX version 1.03, which is documented at http://www.ofx.net
  This also handles QFX, which is OFX plus some minor additions made
  by Intuit, the publishers of Quicken.

  .

  The parser will place all the data into a tree, which you can query
  for whatever data you may need, although you will need to be
  familiar with the OFX spec to do this. There is also a Transaction
  type which you can easily parse from the tree; this will contain
  most, if not all, of the data you will be interested in if your OFX
  file is from a bank or credit card account.

  .

  All the OFX and QFX files I have seen use the format from the 1.0
  series of OFX, which is primarily SGML based. OFX version 2 is XML
  based. If this parser works on those files, consider it a happy
  accident.

  .

  The OFX spec is available at <http://www.ofx.net>
