synopsis:       Provides a way to persist data from compile-time to runtime.
description:    This package provides a way to persist data from compile-time to runtime by
                producing Template Haskell expressions that evaluate to particular values. For
                example, if you have a value @Just 1@, then @toExp (Just 1)@ will produce the
                /expression/ @[e| Just 1 |]@, which can be used in a splice. For a more direct
                example, here’s what that looks like without the quasiquote notation:
                .
                >>> toExp (Just 1)
                AppE (ConE GHC.Base.Just) (LitE (IntegerL 1))
                .
                This is done by using a typeclass, 'ToExp', that can be automatically derived
                for types that have a 'Generic' instance.
