version:        0.5
synopsis:       Multisets with negative membership.
description:    Multisets (or bags) are sets in which elements may occur more than once.
                The number of times an element occurs in a multiset is called its
                /multiplicity/.
                .
                This package provides an efficient implementation of so-called
                /signed multisets/ (also known as hybrid sets or shadow sets), which
                generalise multisets by allowing for /negative membership/.
                That is, elements in a signed multiset can have negative multiplicities.
                .
