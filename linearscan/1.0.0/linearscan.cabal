description:
  The @linearscan@ library is an implementation -- in Coq, extracted to
  Haskell -- of a register allocation algorithm developed by Christian Wimmer.
  It is described in detail in his Masters thesis, which can be found at
  <http://www.christianwimmer.at/Publications/Wimmer04a/Wimmer04a.pdf>.  A
  Java implementation of this same algorithm, by that author, is used in
  Oracle's Graal project. It has also been implemented in C++ by Mozilla.
  .
  This version of the algorithm was written and verified in Coq, containing
  over 231 proved lemmas, at over 10K LOC. It was funded as a research project
  by BAE Systems (<http://www.baesystems.com>), to be used in an in-house
  compiler written in Haskell.
  .
  In order for the Coq code to be usable from Haskell, it is first extracted
  from Coq as a Haskell library, during which many of Coq's fundamental types
  are mapped directly onto counterparts in the Haskell Prelude.
  .
  This library's sole entry point is the function 'LinearScan.allocate', which
  takes a list of basic blocks, and a functional characterization of those
  blocks, and produces a new list, with register allocations applied to their
  component operations.
