cabal-version:      3.0
-- The cabal-version field refers to the version of the .cabal specification,
-- and can be different from the cabal-install (the tool) version and the
-- Cabal (the library) version you are using. As such, the Cabal (the library)
-- version used must be equal or greater than the version stated in this field.
-- Starting from the specification version 2.2, the cabal-version field must be
-- the first thing in the cabal file.

-- Initial package description 'corenlp-types' generated by

description:
        This library introduces types that make it easier to work with [CorenNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) server responses (JSON).

        It is mostly a fork of [`corenlp-parser`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/corenlp-parser-0.4.0.0) however without the rockdb dependency.
