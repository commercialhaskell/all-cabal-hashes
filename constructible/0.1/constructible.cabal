synopsis:            Exact computation with constructible real numbers
description:
  The constructible reals are the subset of the real numbers that can
  be represented exactly using field operations (addition,
  subtraction, multiplication, division) and positive square roots.
  They support exact computations, equality comparisons, and ordering.
