description:
    Create and query sets that are indexed by multiple indices.
    .
    This is a variant of the ixset package that tracks the index
    information via the type system. It should be safer to use than
    ixset, but also requires more GHC extensions.
    .
    The two packages are currently relatively compatible. Switching
    from one to the other requires a little bit of manual work, but
    not very much.
