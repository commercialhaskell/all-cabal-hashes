Synopsis:            First class patterns and pattern matching, using type families
Description:

	This package implements a library of first class patterns. The
	initial basis for this library was Morten Rhiger's \"Type-safe
	pattern combinators\"; the patterns can be used in an almost
	identical way to those of Morten Rhiger. In a series of blog
	posts at
	<http://reinerp.wordpress.com/category/pattern-combinators/>
	the types of patterns were made more revealing using type
	families, and a simpler implementation was used which avoids
	some book-keeping.
	.
	The library reimplements most of Haskell's built-in
	pattern matching facilities, plus some more. The pattern
	matches of this library are lightweight: when GHC's
	optimisation is turned on, all overhead should be optimised
	away, leaving a standard Haskell pattern match.
        .
	If you're just reading the documentation for this library for
	the first time, start with "Data.Pattern".
