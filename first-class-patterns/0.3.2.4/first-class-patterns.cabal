Synopsis:            First class patterns and pattern matching, using type families
Description:

  This package implements a library of first class patterns. The
  initial basis for this library was Morten Rhiger's \"Type-safe
  pattern combinators\"; the patterns can be used in an almost
  identical way to those of Morten Rhiger. In a series of blog
  posts at
  <http://reinerp.wordpress.com/category/pattern-combinators/>
  the types of patterns were made more revealing using type
  families, and a simpler implementation was used which avoids
  some book-keeping.
  .
  The library reimplements most of Haskell's built-in
  pattern matching facilities, plus some more. The pattern
  matches of this library are lightweight: when GHC's
  optimisation is turned on, all overhead should be optimised
  away, leaving a standard Haskell pattern match.
  .
  If you're just reading the documentation for this library for
  the first time, start with "Data.Pattern".
