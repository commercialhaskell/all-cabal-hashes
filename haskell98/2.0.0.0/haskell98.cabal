synopsis:	Compatibility with Haskell 98
category:   Haskell98
description:
	This package provides compatibility with the modules of Haskell
	98 and the FFI addendum, by means of wrappers around modules from
	the base package (which in many cases have additional features).
	However Prelude, Numeric and Foreign are provided directly by
	the base package.
