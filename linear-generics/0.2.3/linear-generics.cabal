synopsis:               Generic programming library for generalised deriving.
description:
  This package offers a version of
  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/GHC-Generics.html GHC.Generics>
  with two important improvements:
  .
  1. The @to@, @from@, @to1@, and @from1@ methods have multiplicity-polymorphic
     types, allowing them to be used with either traditional Haskell code or
     linearly typed code.
  .
  2. The representations used for @Generic1@ are modified slightly. As a result,
     @to1@ and @from1@ never need to use @fmap@. This can
     <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/15969 greatly improve performance>,
     and it is
     <https://github.com/tweag/linear-base/pull/316 necessary to support multiplicity polymorphism>.
     A smaller change, approximately
     <https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/7492 as proposed by spl>,
     reduces the number of instances that must be written to actually use @Generic1@
     for deriving instances of other classes.
  .
     For more details, see the "Generics.Linear" documentation.
  .
  The implementation is based on the @generic-deriving@ package, first described in the paper
  .
  *  /A generic deriving mechanism for Haskell/.
     Jose Pedro Magalhaes, Atze Dijkstra, Johan Jeuring, and Andres Loeh.
     Haskell'10.
  .
  This library is organized as follows:
  .
  * "Generics.Linear" defines the core functionality for generics,
    including the multiplicity-polymorphic @Generic(1)@ classes and
    a replacement for the @:.:@ composition type.
  .
  * "Generics.Linear.TH" implements Template Haskell functionality for
    deriving instances of @Generic(1)@.
  .
  * "Generics.Linear.Unsafe.ViaGHCGenerics" offers @DerivingVia@ targets to
    derive @Generic@ and @Generic1@ instances from
    @"GHC.Generics".'GHC.Generics.Generic'@. Because these instances necessarily
    use unsafe coercions, their use will likely inhibit full optimization of
    code using them.
  .
  Educational code: the educational modules exported by
  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-deriving generic-deriving>
  have been copied into the @tests\/Generic\/Deriving@ directory
  in this repository, with the very few modifications required to
  accommodate the differences between the @Generic1@ representations
  here and in @base@. All the same caveats apply as in the originals;
  see that package's @README@.
