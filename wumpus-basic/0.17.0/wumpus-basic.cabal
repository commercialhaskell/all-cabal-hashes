description:
  .
  Kernel code for higher-level drawing built on Wumpus-Core.
  This package provides font loader code (limited to AFM font 
  files) and a various /drawing objects/ intended to be a 
  higher-level basis to make vector drawings than the primitives 
  (paths, text labels) provided by Wumpus-Core. 
  .
  \*\* WARNING \*\* - this package is alpha grade and it is 
  strongly coupled to the package @Wumpus-Drawing@ which is 
  sub-alpha grade. The packages are split as it is expected they
  will have different development speeds - @Wumpus-Basic@ needs 
  polishing and refinement; @Wumpus-Drawing@ simply needs a lot of
  work to move its components from /proof-of-concept/ ideas to 
  being readily usable. 
  .
  .
  NOTE - the demos that were previously included are now in the
  package @Wumpus-Drawing@. 
  .
  .
  Changelog:
  . 
  v0.16.0 to v0.17.0:
  .
  * Changed representation of ContextFuns - context funs are no 
    longer an arity family of newtypes. The new representation 
    is simpler, but some of the opportunities for overloading 
    have been lost.
  .
  * Substantial round of renaming for the @DrawingContext@ types
    an query and update functions.
  .
  * Re-worked the font metrics and font loader modules. The new
    names should be more systematic. Removed the need for the 
    GhostScript font modules to match PostScript names to 
    GhostScript font files.    
  .
  * Superceded the PointSupplyM class by adding snapping grid 
    scaling to the DrawingContext. 
  . 
  * Removed @ScalingContext@ module.
  .
  * Made text colour a distinct property in the DrawingContext. 
    Text is now drawn with the text colour rather than the stroke 
    colour.
  .
  * Added FontLoadLog to the DrawingContext - this allows access 
    to the errors recorded during font loading.
  .
  v0.15.0 to v0.16.0:
  .
  * Moved the Geometry modules from Wumpus-Drawing into 
    Wumpus-Basic.
  .
  * Re-worked the @CtxPicture@ API, although the current naming 
    scheme is not satisfactory.
  .
  * Added extra Anchor classes.
  .
  * Added @PosImage@ object - this is a rectangle-framed object 
    that can be drawn from any of its corners or its center. 
  .
  * Added @CF3@, an arity three /ContextFunction/.
  .
  * Added @Displacement@ module. This defines the @PointDisplace@
    type and provides a library of @PointDisplace@ functions.
    Note - some of the new functions have taken names previously 
    used for anchor projection functions (@northwards@, 
    @southwards@, etc.), anchor projections are now build with the 
    function @projectAnchor@.
  .
  * Added the property @descender@ to the font metrics.
  .
  * Split drawing primitives from type in @Objects.Graphic@, 
    drawing primitives are now in the module 
    @Objects.DrawingPrimitives@.
  .
  v0.14.0 to v0.15.0:
  . 
  * Split previous @Wumpus-Basic@ package into two packages:
    @Wumpus-Basic@ and @Wumpus-Drawing@. This is a pratical move 
    to separate the developed (although not yet polished) @Kernel@ 
    and @FontLoader@ code from the prototypical @Drawing@ code.
  .
  * Renamed the @Drawing@ object to @CtxPicture@. Although 
    @CtxPicture@ is a less pleasant name, it should be less 
    confusing. A @CtxPicture@ is the essentially the @Picture@ 
    type from Wumpus-Core with an implicit context - 
    @ContextPicture@ is simply too long and @CtxPicture@ is 
    almost jibberish but the previous unrelated name @Drawing@ 
    was not helpful.
  .
  * @Kernel.Base.ScalingContext@ has been simplified. 
    ScalingContexts are no longer manipulated via a custom Reader
    monad or transformer as the type signatures were too unwieldy.
  .
  * Added @TextMargin@ to the @DrawingContext@ - Wumpus-Drawing 
    can now calculate more appealing bounding boxes for text.
  .
