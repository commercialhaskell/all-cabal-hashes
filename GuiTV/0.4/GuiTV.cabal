Name:                GuiTV
Version:             0.4
Synopsis:	     GUIs for Tangible Values
Category:            Interfaces, User Interfaces
Description:
  GuiTV is a very small library that extends the TV (tangible value)
  framework with graphical user interfaces, using Phooey.  (See
  <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/TV> and
  <http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Phooey>.)  The functionality was part of
  the TV package up to version 0.1.1.  I moved it out to eliminate the
  dependency of core TV on Phooey and hence on wxHaskell, as the latter
  can be difficult to install.
  .
  Try out the examples in @src\/Examples.hs@.
