synopsis:
  Patience diff and longest increasing subsequence
description:
  This library implements the \"patience diff\" algorithm, as well as the patience
  algorithm for the longest increasing subsequence problem.
  .
  Patience diff computes the difference between two lists, for example the
  lines of two versions of a source file.  It provides a good balance of
  performance, nice output for humans, and implementation simplicity.  For more
  information, see <http://alfedenzo.livejournal.com/170301.html> and
