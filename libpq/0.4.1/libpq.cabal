Synopsis:            libpq binding for Haskell

Description:         This is a binding to libpq: the C application
                     programmer's interface to PostgreSQL. libpq is a
                     set of library functions that allow client
                     programs to pass queries to the PostgreSQL
                     backend server and to receive the results of
                     these queries.
