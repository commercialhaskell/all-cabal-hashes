Synopsis:            Interactive diagram windows
Description:         Haskell excels at handling data like continuous functions
                     in a nice way, i.e. without discretising anything to finite arrays as
                     is typically done in languages like Matlab. Instead, you can simply pass
                     around functions or infinite data structures (or /very/ high-resolution data
                     that would be infeasible to handle in a strict language).
                     .
                     However when you want to /view/ the data, it will eventually need to be exported out of Haskell
                     in some finite form. The purpose of this library is to delay this discretisation
                     as long as possible: it implements an interactive plotting window that accepts continuous/recursive
                     data and only &#x201c;flattens&#x201d; it according to the specific view configuration.
                     You can then zoom in to a shown diagram and it will automatically calculate
                     the features more detailedly, or zoom out and discover previosly unexpected
                     features. You don't need to worry about specifying the range and/or resolution beforehand:
                     the program will try to find a suitable default view based on /all/ data your displaying,
                     and you can always still zoom, resize or move later.
                     .
                     <http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams> are used as the &#x201c;pre-rendered&#x201d; type. This
                     makes the output usable in a very wide range of applications, though at the moment only the GTK
                     window view is implemented.
