version:        0.1.3
synopsis:       Manipulate and convert strings of characters uniformly and consistently
description:    Reduce complexity of Haskell by providing a 
                .
                - set of uniformly named conversion functions between 
                .
                    - String, 
                .
                    - Text, 
                .
                    - ByteString, 
                .
                    - LazyByteString and 
                .
                    - urlEncoding
                .
                with the most important text manipulation functions for string and text
                where the semantic is the same (tested with quickcheck).
                Tentatively some infix string manipulations are offered as well. 
                .
                v 0.1.3 added stack build lts 19.16 for ghc 9.0.2
                .
