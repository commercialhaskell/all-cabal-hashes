flag use-build-tool-depends
  description: Sometimes Cabal doesn't see build tools listed in
    build-tool-depends if they are installed by means other than
    cabal-install (e.g., Nix). In those cases, not even mentioning
    the tools in build-tool-depends prevents cabal-install from
    attempting to reinstall them. This is an automatic flag, so
    in theory Cabal will figure out what it needs to do.
