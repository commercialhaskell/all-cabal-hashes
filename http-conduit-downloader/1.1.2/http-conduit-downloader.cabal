synopsis:       HTTP downloader tailored for web-crawler needs.
description:
    HTTP/HTTPS downloader built on top of @http-client@
    and used in <https://bazqux.com> crawler.
    .
    Previously it was based on @http-conduit@ (hence the name) but since
    all the necessary parts are in @http-client@ now @http-conduit@ is no
    longer used.
    .
     * Handles all possible http-client exceptions and returns
       human readable error messages.
    .
     * Handles some web server bugs (returning 'deflate' data instead of 'gzip',
       invalid 'gzip' encoding).
    .
     * Uses OpenSSL instead of 'tls' package (since 'tls' doesn't handle all sites and works slower than OpenSSL).
    .
     * Ignores invalid SSL sertificates.
    .
     * Receives data in 32k chunks internally to reduce memory fragmentation
       on many parallel downloads.
    .
     * Download timeout.
    .
     * Total download size limit.
    .
     * Returns HTTP headers for subsequent redownloads and handles
       'Not modified' results.
    .
     * Can be used with external DNS resolver (e.g. @concurrent-dns-cache@).
