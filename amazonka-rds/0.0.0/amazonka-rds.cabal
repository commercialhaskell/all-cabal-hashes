description:
    Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that
    makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in
    the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while
    managing time-consuming database administration tasks, freeing you up
    to focus on your applications and business.
