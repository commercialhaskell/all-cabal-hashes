synopsis:            Algorithmic Doom map generation
description:         A system for constructing maps for the computer game Doom
                     by writing algorithms to describe the geometry. A Liquorice
                     program is a series of instructions to move a virtual
                     "turtle" or "pen", which define the walls, floors, rooms
                     and monsters as it goes.
