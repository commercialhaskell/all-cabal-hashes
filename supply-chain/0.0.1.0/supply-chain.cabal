synopsis: Composable request-response pipelines

description:
    @Job@ is a free monad, plus a little extra. It is parameterized on
    two type constructors: one for dynamic effects, and one for static
    effects. The @Vendor@ type is similar to job, but a vendor can also
    /respond to/ requests, and thus it has two dynamic interfaces: one
    upstream and one downstream. We can connect vendors to jobs or to
    other vendors, creating a pipeline (or "supply chain", if you like)
    along the dynamic interfaces.
