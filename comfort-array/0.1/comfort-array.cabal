Synopsis:         Arrays where the index type is a function of the shape type
Description:
  Arrays from the basic @array@ package are already very powerful
  compared with arrays in other languages.
  They may have any number of dimensions, are type safe
  and defined in a uniform way using the Ix class
  with free choice of the lower bounds (0, 1, or whatever you like).
  .
  This package goes one step further:
  The shape and the index type are different,
  but the index type is a type function of the shape type.
  This offers much more flexibility and type safety.
  .
  Some examples are:
  .
  * @Range@:
    Allow dynamic choice of lower and upper array bounds
    such as in the 'Array's from the @array@ package.
    You can combine it with other shapes in other dimensions.
    It allows you to describe the bounds of each dimension individually.
  .
  * @Shifted@:
    Describe array bounds by start index and length.
    It is sometimes more natural to use these parameters.
    E.g. a non-negative index type like 'Word' cannot represent @-1@
    and thus cannot encode an empty range starting with index @0@.
  .
  * @Square@:
    An 2D array where both dimensions always have equal size.
  .
  * @ZeroBased, OneBased@:
    Arrays with fixed lower bound, either 0 or 1, respectively.
  .
  * @(:+:)@:
    The Append type constructor allows to respresent block arrays,
    e.g. block matrices.
  .
  * Arrays with indices like 'LT', 'EQ', 'GT' and dummy shape.
  .
  The @lapack@ package defines even more fancy shapes
  like tall rectangular matrices, triangular matrices and banded matrices.
