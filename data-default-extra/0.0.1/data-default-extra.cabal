synopsis:               A class for types with a default value.
description:
  An alternative to
  <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/data-default data-default> package, that
  provides a lot of additional instances for @Default@ type class.
  .
  @Default@ type class provides a default value (@def@) of a type. In case when
  a particluar type has an instance for @Monoid@, then the default value should
  be @mempty@, otherwise it can cause a great deal of confusion.
  .
  One must understand, that @Default@ type class, has no axioms associated with
  it. Its purpose is to minimize:
  .
  * Number of imports.
  .
  * Number of introduced definitions that are part of an API.
  .
  * Complexity of building more complicated \"default values\" out of
    simpler \"default values\".
  .
  * Cognitive overhead. (Reduction of cognitive overhead is partially a
    consequence of reducing above issues.)
  .
  As one may notice, most of the listed problems, that @Default@ type class
  tries to solve, to various degrees of success, are for human benefit, and not
  theoretically founded. Because of this, please always try hard to define
  sensible instances of @Default@. Most importantly, document what @def@ means
  for particular type, and always check that @def@ is sensible, by testing it
  on a real world sample of human beings, one is not a big enough sample.
  .
  That said, using @Default@ may not always be a good idea. If it breaks
  people's mental model, or theoretical models with real axioms, then just
  don't use it.
