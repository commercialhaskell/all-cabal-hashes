Synopsis: Explicit Runge-Kutta methods of various orders (fork of 'rungekutta')
Description: This package contains a collection of explicit Runge-Kutta
             methods of various orders, some with fixed-size steps (no
             error estimate) and some intended for adaptive stepsize
             (ie, they include an error estimate). There are a couple of
             test programs which include some adaptive stepsize control,
             however there is not yet any such routine in the library
             itself.
             .
             This package started as a fork of 'rungekutta-1.0.3' (which had been dormant since 2009), with proper documentation and modern project structure.
