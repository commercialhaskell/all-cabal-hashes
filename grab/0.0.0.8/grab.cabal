    == The Grab type

    A grab consumes some portion (none, part, or all) of
    its input @bag@, and returns a @residue@ consisting of
    the unconsumed input, some monoidal @log@ (e.g. a list
    of error messages), and some @desideratum@ (the object
    of desire) produced from the consumed input, or
    @Nothing@ if the grab failed.

    > newtype Grab bag residue log desideratum =
    >   Grab (
    >     bag -> (residue, log, Maybe desideratum)
    >   )

    Grabs are useful as parsers for inputs such as JSON
    objects or lists of form parameters, where the input data
    is not necessarily given linearly in the same order in
    which we want to consume it.

    == Applicative composition

    A @Simple@ grab (where the @bag@ and @residue@ are the
    same type) has an @Applicative@ instance.

    > instance (bag ~ residue, Monoid log) =>
    >     Applicative (Grab bag residue log)

    For example, we can create two simple list grabs, one that
    grabs multiples of two, and the other that grabs multiples
    of three:

    > twos, threes :: Monoid log =>
    >     Control.Grab.Simple [Integer] log [Integer]
    > twos   = partition (Data.List.partition (\x -> mod x 2 == 0))
    > threes = partition (Data.List.partition (\x -> mod x 3 == 0))

    > λ> runGrabMaybe ((,) <$> twos @() <*> threes @()) [1..10]
    > Just ([2,4,6,8,10],[3,9])

    Notice that the second part of the resulting tuple contains only
    the /odd/ multiples of three. Because @twos@ runs first, it
    consumes @6@ before the @threes@ can get it.

    == Pipeline composition

    @a / b@ is a pipeline of two grabs, where the desideratum from
    @a@ is the @bag@ for @b@.
    .
    > (/) :: Semigroup log
    >     => Grab bag residue log x
    >     -> Grab x  _residue log desideratum
    >     -> Grab bag residue log desideratum

    > λ> runGrabMaybe (twos @() / threes @()) [1..10]
    > Just [6]

    > λ> runGrabMaybe ((,) <$> (twos @() / threes @()) <*> threes @()) [1..10]
    > Just ([6],[3,9])
