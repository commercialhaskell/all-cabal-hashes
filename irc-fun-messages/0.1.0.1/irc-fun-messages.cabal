name:                irc-fun-messages
version:             0.1.0.1
synopsis:            Types and functions for working with the IRC protocol.
description:
  Another IRC library. It doesn't provide a client API though. It just provides
  datatypes, and functions for parsing and serializing IRC commands and
  replies.
  .
  The package is based on RFC 2812, with modifications and extensions to work
  with Freenode.
  .
  NOTE: The handling of IRC protocol messages is FAR from complete, but there
  is enough to e.g. create a basic IRC bot. Missing features are being added as
  needed while working on <http://rel4tion.org/projects/funbot FunBot>, and of
  course patches are welcome.
