Synopsis:            Functional Enumeration of Algebraic Types
Description:         Feat (Functional Enumeration of Algebraic Types) provides
                     enumerations as functions from natural numbers to values
                     (similar to @toEnum@ but for any algebraic data type). This
                     can be used for SmallCheck-style systematic testing,
                     QuickCheck style random testing, and hybrids of the two.
                     .
                     The enumerators are defined in a very boilerplate manner
                     and there is a Template Haskell script for deriving the
                     class instance for most types.
                     "Test.Feat" contain a subset of the other modules that
                     should be sufficient for most test usage. There
                     are some small and large example in the tar
                     ball.
                     .
                     The generators are provided by the size-based package. This means other libraries that implement the Sized class can use the same generator definitions. One such is the
                     <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lazy-search lazy-search package>, that uses laziness to search for values and test properties. This is typically a lot faster than Feat for properties that have preconditions (logical implication), but can not be used for random selection of values.
