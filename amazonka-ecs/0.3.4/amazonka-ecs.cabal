description:
    Amazon EC2 Container Service is a highly scalable, high performance container
    management service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily
    run distributed applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.
    Amazon EC2 Container Service lets you launch and stop container-enabled
    applications with simple API calls, allows you to query the state of your
    cluster from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar
    Amazon EC2 features like security groups, EBS volumes and IAM roles. You can
    use EC2 Container Service to schedule the placement of containers across your
    cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability
    requirements. Amazon EC2 Container Service eliminates the need for you to
    operate your own cluster management and configuration management systems or
    worry about scaling your management infrastructure.
