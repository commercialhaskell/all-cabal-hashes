description:
    This package provides the Language.Haskell.TH.Desugar module, which desugars
    Template Haskell's rich encoding of Haskell syntax into a simpler encoding.
    This desugaring discards surface syntax information (such as the use of infix
    operators) but retains the original meaning of the TH code. The intended use
    of this package is as a preprocessor for more advanced code manipulation
    tools. Note that the input to any of the ds... functions should be produced
    from a TH quote, using the syntax [| ... |]. If the input to these functions
    is a hand-coded TH syntax tree, the results may be unpredictable. In
    particular, it is likely that promoted datatypes will not work as expected.
