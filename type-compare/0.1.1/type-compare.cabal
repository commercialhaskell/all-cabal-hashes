synopsis:       Type-level Ord compatibility layer
description:    In @base-4.16.0.0@, an open type family @Compare@ was added as a type-level
                analog of @Ord@.  This package provides a compatible interface on earlier
                versions of @base@, and re-exports the canonical one with later versions.
