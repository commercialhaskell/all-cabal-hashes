version:             0.1.0.0
x-revision: 1
synopsis:            Fully-flexible polymorphic lenses, without any bizarre profunctors
description:         A snowclone of the great <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens>
                     library. It implements the full hierarchy from isomorphisms to
                     setters and folds, but instead of the Van Laarhoven implementation with
                     universally-quantified functor mappings (powerful and elegant, but
                     infamously beginner-scaring), it encapsulates the various
                     realworld-usecase signatures like get+set or build+distinguish
                     in a well-confined type family and expresses the relations between the
                     different optics explicitly, with a dedicated class hierarchy.
                     .
