synopsis:            Collision-resistant IDs
description:         CUIDs are designed for horizontal scalability and collision
                     resistance.

                     This module does not use crypto-strength sources of
                     randomness.
                     Use at your own peril!
                     .
                     For better or worse, this module uses semantic versioning
                     (see <http://semver.org/>).
                     That is, if you want to depend upon, for example, version 1
                     of the API, you should add hscuid ==1.* to your Cabal
                     file. No breaking changes will be (deliberately) introduced
                     under that version number.
