synopsis:       Rendering to pseudo-Haskell syntax
description:    This provides a single place to describe how a type should be formatted as
                pseudo-Haskell syntax, independently of the actual pretty-printing library
                (e.g. "pretty", "ansi-wl-pprint", or "prettyprinter") that will ultimately be
                used to render it.  This means packages can cheaply provide integration with
                all pretty-printers by providing an instance of this class, without needing
                to depend on any of them (or their layout algorithms).
                .
                Of course, this comes at the cost of targeting a predeclared set of
                formatting choices.  If there are any egregious omissions, we can always add
                more constructors.
                .
                This library is explicitly not intended to provide a way to express
                /all documents/; only a particular flavor of pseudo-Haskell syntax
                representing values and types.
