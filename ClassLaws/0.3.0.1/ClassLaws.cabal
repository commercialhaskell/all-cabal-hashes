-- A longer description of the package.

description: The specification of a class in Haskell often starts with
  stating, in text, the laws that should be satisfied by methods
  defined in instances of the class, followed by the type of the
  methods of the class. The ClassLaws library is a framework that
  supports testing such class laws using QuickCheck.  Our framework is
  a light-weight class law testing framework, which requires a limited
  amount of work per class law, and per datatype for which the class
  law is tested.  We also show how to test class laws with
  partially-defined values.  Using partially-defined values, we show
  that the standard lazy and strict implementations of the state monad
  do not satisfy the expected laws. More information can be found at
