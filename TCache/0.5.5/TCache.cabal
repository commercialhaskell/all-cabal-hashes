synopsis:            A Transactional data cache with configurable persistence 
description: 
        Data.Tcache is a transactional cache with configurable persistence. It tries to simulate Hibernate 
        for Java or Rails for Ruby. The main difference is that transactions are done in memory trough STM. 
        There are transactional cache implementations for some J2EE servers like JBOSS.

        TCache uses STM. It can  atomically apply a function to a list of cached objects. The resulting 
        objects go back to the cache (withResources). It also can retrieve these objects (getResources).  
        Persistence can be syncronous (syncCache)  or asyncronous, wtih configurable time between cache 
        writes and configurable cache clearance strategy. the size of the cache can be configured too . 
        All of this can be done trough clearSyncCacheProc. Even the TVar variables can be accessed 
        directly (getTVar) to acceess all the semantic of atomic blocks while maintaining the persistence of the 
        TVar updates.

        Persistence can be defined for each object: Each object must have a defined key, a default filename
        path (if applicable). Persistence is pre-defined in files, but the readResource writeResource and 
        delResource methods can be redefined to persist in databases or whatever.

        There are  Samples here that explain the main features.
        
        
        In this release:
           Added a Data.TCache.Dynamic.  (SEE dynamicsample.hs)
             - Can handle, transact, and serialize to disk many datatypes simultaneously and incrementally
             - Dynamic uses the same interface than TCache and add *DResource(s) calls 
             - Safe dynamic data handling trough a lighter, indexable and serializable version of Data.Dynamic
             - Added KEY object for retrieving any object of any type.
