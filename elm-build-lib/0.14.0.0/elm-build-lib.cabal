name:           elm-build-lib
version:        0.14.0.0
Synopsis:       Compile Elm code to JS within Haskell
Description:    This library provides both runtime and Template Haskell functions which let you take multi-module
    Elm Programs and compile them to JavaScript.
    The main goal of this is to allow Elm to be used as a frontend for Haskell servers or Web apps.
    The library is independent of any specific framework, so it should work with Yesod, Snap, Happstack, Scotty, etc.
