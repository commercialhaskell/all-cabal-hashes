Name:                pwstore-fast
Version:             2.2
Synopsis:            Secure password storage.
Description:         To store passwords securely, they should be salted,
                     then hashed with a slow hash function. This library
                     uses PBKDF1-SHA256, and handles all the details.
                     It uses the cryptohash package for speed; if you need
                     a pure Haskell library, pwstore-purehaskell has the
                     exact same API, but uses only pure Haskell. It is
                     about 25 times slower than this package, but still 
                     quite usable.
