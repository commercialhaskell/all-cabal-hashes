synopsis:                  Parsing library with unbiased choice and support for embedding arbitrary monad
description:               Parsing library with unbiased choice and support for embedding arbitrary monad.

 You may use applicative or arrow style. Supports left recursion, location tracking, parsing and semantic error messages, heuristic ambiguity checking. Based on Earley.

-- When following links below, keep in mind that "doctest" and "docspec" are two different words. Also keep in mind that "cabal-doctest" is not the only way to integrate cabal and doctest
-- I use simple way of cabal/doctest integration, described in https://github.com/sol/doctest/blob/d5b10128403663f7dc581477c7c7eb28a6f26f5a/README.markdown in section "Cabal integration"
-- Alternative way is to use "cabal-doctest" ( https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-doctest-1.0.8 ), i. e. to write custom Setup.hs. But this requires boilerplate. Also, this can cause problems: https://github.com/ekmett/distributive/pull/53 , https://github.com/ekmett/distributive/issues/37
-- Another alternative way is not to integrate doctest and cabal at all and simply run "doctest" or "cabal-doctest" from continuous integration directly. But this will require us to specify all dependencies for tests in CI scripts. This is ugly
-- Note that author of cabal-doctest doesn't use this program anymore: https://github.com/ekmett/distributive/pull/53#issuecomment-744024619
-- So, we choose that way from doctest's README
-- To make it work "cabal v2-build" should write environment files. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/58027909 and https://github.com/ekmett/comonad/pull/58/commits/264f9057ea37cbffeb83744ff667ead4aa0f456a#diff-73f8a010e9b95aa9fe944c316576b12c2ec961272d428e38721112ecb1c1a98bR205 (note: this link shows how to run cabal-docspec, not cabal-doctest)
-- On docspec: the author doesn't think docspec is "useful for others": https://github.com/ekmett/distributive/pull/60#discussion_r549900441
