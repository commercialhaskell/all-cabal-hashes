cabal-version:      3.0
-- The cabal-version field refers to the version of the .cabal specification,
-- and can be different from the cabal-install (the tool) version and the
-- Cabal (the library) version you are using. As such, the Cabal (the library)
-- version used must be equal or greater than the version stated in this field.
-- Starting from the specification version 2.2, the cabal-version field must be
-- the first thing in the cabal file.

-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis: A functional DSL for vertex-centric large-scale graph processing

-- A longer description of the package.
description:
  Fregel (Functional Pregel) is a functional domain-specific language for developing programs of vertex-centric (i.e., Pregel) style of big graph processing, in which the computation at every vertex is abstracted as a higher-order function. Fregel has clear functional semantics and supports declarative description of vertex computation. 

  The current Fregel processor is a translator (compiler) from Fregel code into Giraph code in Java / Pregel+ code in C++.

  Technical details can be found in the JFP paper (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0956796821000277 ). 

  Note that some optimization options need Z3, an SMT solver, to be installed in your system.
