version:             0.1.0.0
x-revision: 3
synopsis:            A sequence of semigroups, for composing stuff in multiple spatial directions.
description:         Some types are composable in multiple “directions”, either in
                     a literal sense (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/diagrams diagrams>
                     can be stacked vertically, as well as layed out side-by-side)
                     or in an abstraction (matrices etc.). This package offers a whole
                     sequence of semigroup-classes, numbered by type-literals, as
                     a unified interface for composition of such types. It also has
                     a bunch of standardised operators for writing out the compositions
                     in a snug way.
