Synopsis:            Shell scripts for support of Cabal maintenance
Description:
  This is a collection of Bash shell scripts
  for support of Cabal package development.
  The scripts are installed in your @cabal/share@ directory,
  thus you may extend your command search path accordingly.
  .
  If you are in the directory of @mypkg@
  (the directory that contains @mypkg.cabal@),
  then you may run scripts in the following way:
  .
  * @cabal-test dist/mypkg-0.1.tar.gz@:
    Unpack the tarball in the @/tmp@ directory
    and try to build it using Cabal.
    This check helps to find missing files in the Cabal package description.
  .
  * @cabal-darcs-bump-version 0.2@:
    Replaces the package and the repository version number
    in your Cabal file by 0.2
    and records an according Darcs patch.
  .
  * @cabal-darcs-upload 0.2@:
    This command supports the following workflow:
    Say, on Hackage there is version 0.0.1 of your package
    and the cabal file in the darcs repository says @Version: 0.1@.
    Now you decide to finish that version
    and to work next on the version 0.2.
    This is the time when you call @cabal-darcs-upload 0.2@.
    The call runs @cabal-test@ and @cabal check@ before uploading.
    Then it tags the repository with the current package version number.
    Then it uploads the package to Hackage.
    Finally it bumps the version of the package to @0.2@.
    This workflow makes sure,
    that you never have two different contents for the same version
    in Hackage and in your darcs repository.
    If you set the environment variable HACKAGEUSER,
    then this will be automatically used for upload.
  .
  * @cabal-darcs-repository@:
    Shows some lines of @Source-Repository@ fields,
    that you may copy into @mypkg.cabal@.
    We fetch the repository URL from Darcs files.
    Unfortunately, as developer
    you will certainly use a private read-write access
    to your repository like @code.haskell.org:\/home\/user\/mypkg\/@,
    whereas the Cabal field may contain a public read-only access,
    such as @http:\/\/code.haskell.org\/~user\/mypkg\/@.
  .
  * @cabal-main-directory@
    If started in a source sub-directory
    then it prints the closest super-directory containing a cabal file.
    This way a build script can automatically find the directory
    where to run @cabal build@.
  .
  * @cabal-find-revdeps author package@:
    Find all Cabal files of packages of a certain author
    that import a certain package.
    This is intended for updating a bunch of packages,
    when a new version of a basic packages shall be supported.
    In this use case, @author@ should be your name
    and @package@ should be the basic package to adapt to.
    Actually the script is very silly
    and just scans for the author name and the package name
    and does not check, where in the Cabal file they occur.
    Thus be prepared for false positives search results.
    The script also filters out package paths that contain underscores
    in order to hide paths in @_darcs@ directories
    and branched darcs repositories
    that usually have names like @pkg_0@.
    I advise to process the packages with
    @
    for pkg in \`cabal-find-revdeps author package\` ; do
       (cd \`dirname $pkg\`; bash);
    done
    @.
    This @for@ loop will take you successively into every package directory.
    There you can perform some operations
    and you can browse the shell history for the commands
    you performed for the previous packages.
    If you are finished with a package, then you just call @exit@,
    and the @for@ loop automatically puts you in the next package directory.
  See also package @cabal-sort@ that provides
  the commands @cabal-sort@ and @ghc-pkg-dep@.
