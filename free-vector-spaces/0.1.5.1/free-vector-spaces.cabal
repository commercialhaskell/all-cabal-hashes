version:             0.1.5.1
synopsis:            Instantiate the classes from the vector-space package with types from linear
description:         The <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/linear/ linear> package offers efficient
                     vector types — where vector means /element of a free vector space/, i.e.
                     fixed-length arrays of numbers. The entire interface of that library is based on
                     this  concept of free vectors with a canonical coordinate representation.
                     .
                     While this is practically speaking often useful, it is also
                     .
                     * Questionable in terms of conceptual elegance. The idea of a vector has
                       originally not much to do with number-arrays; in physics a vector is just
                       a quantity with /magnitude and direction/. Only by fixing a basis can
                       a coordinate representation arise from that.
                     .
                     * Not as safe as we'd like. The typical linear-algebra languages like Matlab
                       or Fortran are notorious for hard-to spot mistakes that often arise from the 
                       total reliance on coordinate representations (every vector/linear map is just
                       a matrix of number). @linear@ already avoids most of these problems because
                       it can at least check dimensions at compile-time and usually doesn't need
                       any indices, but some trouble still remains. E.g., two different 3-dimensional
                       spaces are indistinguishable by the type system (unless you wrap one of them
                       in a @newtype@, however that also needs to be parameterised on the coordinate
                       type to work with the rest of the library).
                     .
                     The <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-space/ vector-space> library
                     has arguably a better (albeit less complete) interface. To gain access to
                     that interface with the more efficient types from @linear@, we here provide
                     the necessary orphan instances.
