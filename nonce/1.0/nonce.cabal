description:
  According to the Wikipedia, a nonce is an arbitrary number used
  only once in a cryptographic communication.  This package
  contain helper functions for generating nonces.
  .
  There are many kinds of nonces used in different situations.
  It's not guarantee that by using the nonces from this package
  you won't have any security issues.  Please make sure that the
  nonces generated via this package are usable on your design.
