version:        0.1.0.0
synopsis:       GNU Terry Pratchett - Add the X-Clacks-Overhead Header to Wai Responses.
description:    /"You know they'll never really die while the Trunk is alive."/
                .
                @wai-middleware-clacks@ is a middleware that inserts an arbitrary
                @X-Clacks-Overhead@ header into every Wai response. From
                <http://gnuterrypratchett.com GNU Terry Pratchett>:
                .
                > In Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, the clacks are a series of
                > semaphore towers loosely based on the concept of the telegraph. Invented
                > by an artificer named Robert Dearheart, the towers could send messages
                > "at the speed of light" using standardized codes. Three of these codes
                > are of particular import:
                >
                > G: send the message on
                > N: do not log the message
                > U: turn the message around at the end of the line and send it back again
                >
                > When Dearheart's son John died due to an accident while working on a
                > clacks tower, Dearheart inserted John's name into the overhead of the
                > clacks with a "GNU" in front of it as a way to memorialize his son forever
                > (or for at least as long as the clacks are standing.)
                >
                >
                > Keeping the legacy of Sir Terry Pratchett alive forever. For as long as
                > his name is still passed along the Clacks, Death can't have him.
