Name:                lub
Version:             0.1.7
Cabal-Version:       >= 1.2
Synopsis:            information operators: least upper bound (lub) and greatest lower bound (glb)
Category:            Concurrency, Data, Other
Description:
  Lub is an experiment in computing least upper information bounds on
  (partially defined) functional values.  It provides a 'lub' function
  that is consistent with the 'unamb' operator but has a more liberal
  precondition.  Where 'unamb' requires its arguments to equal when
  neither is bottom, 'lub' is able to synthesize a value from the
  partial information contained in both of its arguments.
  .
  This module also defines 'glb', which intersects information.
