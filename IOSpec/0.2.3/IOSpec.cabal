Synopsis:       	A pure specification of the IO monad.
Description:		This package consists of several modules, that give a
			pure specification of functions in the IO monad:
			.
                           * "Test.IOSpec.Fork": a pure specification of
			      'forkIO'.
			.
			   * "Test.IOSpec.IORef": a pure specification of most
			      functions that create and manipulate on 'IORefs'.
			.
			   * "Test.IOSpec.MVar": a pure specification of most
			      functions that create and manipulate and 'MVars'.
			.
			   * "Test.IOSpec.STM": a pure specification of
			      'atomically' and the 'STM' monad.
			.
			   * "Test.IOSpec.Teletype": a pure specification of
			      'getChar', 'putChar', and several related
			      Prelude functions.
			.
			Besides these modules containing the specifications,
			there are a few other important modules:
			.
			   * "Test.IOSpec.Types": defines the 'IOSpec' type and
			     several amenities.
			.
			   * "Test.IOSpec.VirtualMachine": defines a virtual
			     machine on which to execute pure specifications.
			.
			   * "Test.IOSpec.Surrogate": a drop-in replacement for
			     the other modules. Import this and recompile your
			     code once you've finished testing and debugging.
			.
			There are several well-documented examples included 
			with the source distribution.
