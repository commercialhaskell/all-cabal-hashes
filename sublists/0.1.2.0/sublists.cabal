name:                sublists
version:             0.1.2.0
synopsis:            Allows to split lists into sublists with some patterns by quantity.
description:         These patterns can be a list of numbers, or obtained from the monadic or applicative function. Leads to somewhat cycling or regularized structures from the length perspective (these ones can be transformed into other variativity types).
