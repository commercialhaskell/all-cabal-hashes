synopsis:        Sets and maps with 8-bit words for keys
description:
  This library provides variant of @Data.Map@ and @Data.Set@ from
  the @containers@ library where the key is specialized to @Word8@.
  Internally, this uses a 256-bit bitmask for the presence of keys
  and a @SmallArray@ of values of keys that were present. For example,
  the map @{2 => Z, 3 => B, 5 => X, 9 => A}@ would be repsented in
  memory as:
  .
  > Bitmask: 0011010001000000... (240 more zero bits)
  > Value Array: Z,B,X,A
  .
  This is optimized for reads. Lookup is @O(1)@. Union is technically
  @O(1)@ but only because the universe of keys is finite. The current
  implementation always scans through all 256 bits of key space.
