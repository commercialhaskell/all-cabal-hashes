name:                settings
version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            Runtime-editable program settings.
description:
  This library aims to be a tool for constructing a settings management UI on
  top of the relevant part of your program state. The settings tree structure
  definition is separate from the actual setting values, so your program logic
  code doesn't need to be changed. It can access the settings as regular
  Haskell values.
  .
  The settings are presented to the user as a tree hierarchy. The idea has some
  similarity to @git config@ and <http://weechat.org Weechat>'s settings
  system, but isn't identical.
  .
  NOTE: The API is probably not documented well enough. Sorry for that. I'm
  releasing like this because I want to release packages which depend on this
  library. Full docs will be written.
