cabal-version:   2.4

-- The cabal-version field refers to the version of the .cabal specification,
-- and can be different from the cabal-install (the tool) version and the
-- Cabal (the library) version you are using. As such, the Cabal (the library)
-- version used must be equal or greater than the version stated in this field.
-- Starting from the specification version 2.2, the cabal-version field must be
-- the first thing in the cabal file.

-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:
  Tahoe-LAFS directory-like abstraction for collections of data objects.

-- A longer description of the package.
description:
  Tahoe-Directory is an implementation of the Tahoe-LAFS filesystem directory-like abstraction for managing collections of data objects.
  This includes a parser and serializer for the persisted form of these collections.
  It also includes Haskell-friendly abstract representations of and operations on the data.
  It aims for bit-for-bit compatibility with the original Python implementation.
  It will not include an implementation of any network protocol for transferring directories.
  However, its APIs are intended to be easy to integrate with such an implementation.
