Synopsis: A basic library for rate-limiting IO actions.

Description:
  In many cases, it is useful, necessary, or simply nice to limit how
  frequently you perform some action. For example, you may want to limit
  how often your program makes a request of some web site. This library
  is intended as a general-purpose mechanism for rate-limiting IO actions.
