name:           functor-combinators
version:        0.1.1.1
synopsis:       Tools for functor combinator-based program design
description:    Tools for working with /functor combinators/: types that take functors (or
                other indexed types) and returns a new functor that "enhances" or "mixes"
                them in some way.  In the process, you can design featureful programs by
                composing smaller "primitives" using basic unversal combinators.
                .
                The main entry point is "Data.Functor.Combinators", but more fine-grained
                functionality and extra combinators (some of them re-implementations for
                compatibility) are available in other modules as well.
                .
                This library does not define new functor combinators for the most part,
                but rather re-exports them from different parts of the Haskell ecosystem
                and provides a uniform interface.
                .
                See the README for a quick overview, and also
                <https://blog.jle.im/entry/functor-combinatorpedia.html> for an in-depth
                dive into the motivation behind functor combinator-driven development,
                examples of the functor combinators in this library, and details about how
                to use these abstractions!
