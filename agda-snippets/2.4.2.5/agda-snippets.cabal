synopsis:            Render just the Agda snippets of a literate Agda file to HTML
description:         This library provides a very simple function that translates just the code blocks
                     of a literate Agda file to colourised, hyperlinked HTML. The output of this
                     can then be run through Pandoc or other document processors to allow literate 
                     Agda to be comfortably written in any format that allows inline HTML snippets.
                     .
                     There is also a simple command-line application (@agda-snippets@) included 
                     that can be used as a standalone file processor.
                     .
                     The location of library source hyperlinks is configurable, as is the CSS class
                     given to Agda code blocks.
                     .
                     This package is pinned to particular Agda versions, and therefore does not 
                     obey the PVP, as Agda does not. You should use whichever version of this library
                     corresponds to the Agda version you wish to use.
                     .
                     The development version of this library, available from GitHub, may work with
                     development versions of Agda, although it could be broken at any time. If you
                     stick to stable versions, you should be fine.
