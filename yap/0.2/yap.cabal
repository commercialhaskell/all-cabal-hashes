Synopsis:       yet another prelude - a simplistic refactoring with algebraic
                classes
Description:    A simple refactoring of the Prelude numeric classes,
                attempting backwards compatibility for clients by defining
                a few algebraic classes as superclasses of the Haskell 98
                numeric classes.  This yields the following class hierarchy
                (grey classes are unchanged):
                .

                .
                "Prelude.YAP" is an almost-compatible replacement
                for the standard Haskell Prelude, as long as you're
                not defining instances of the numeric classes
                (though defaulting will be affected).
                When importing it, turn on @RebindableSyntax@.
                .
                "Data.YAP.Algebra" contains just the new classes;
                you'll need to import it if you want access to the
                new names, including to define instances.
                .
                Other modules contain some example instances, including
                for the existing types @Complex@ and @Ratio@.
                .
                History:
                .
                 * 0.0: initial version
                .
                 * 0.1: moved 'fromRational' back to 'Fractional', as it
                   isn't well-behaved for all fields.  Removed @realToField@.
                .
                 * 0.2: removed 'Eq' and 'Show' constraints from 'Num',
                   following @base-4.5@.
