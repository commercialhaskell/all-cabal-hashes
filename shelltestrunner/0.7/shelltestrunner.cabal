name:           shelltestrunner
version:        0.7
x-revision: 1
category:       Testing
synopsis:       A tool for testing command-line programs.
description:
 .
 Run a command-line program through \"shell tests\" defined in one or
 more test files. Each test specifies command-line arguments, some input,
 and expected output, stderr output and/or exit status.
 We use test-framework's test runner, so can run tests in parallel.
 shelltestrunner was inspired by the tests in John Wiegley's ledger project.
 .
 Usage:
 .
 > shelltestrunner [FLAGS] EXECUTABLE [TESTFILES ...]
 >
 >   -? --help[=FORMAT]           Show usage information (optional format)
 >   -V --version                 Show version information
 >   -v --verbose                 Higher verbosity
 >   -q --quiet                   Lower verbosity
 >   -d --debug                   show debug messages
 >      --debug-parse             show parsing debug messages and stop
 >   -i --implicit=none|exit|all  provide implicit tests (default=exit)
 .
 Any unrecognised options will be passed through to test-framework's runner.
 You may be able to get a big speedup by running tests in parallel: try -j16.
 .
 A test file contains one or more shell tests, each of which looks like this:
 .
 > # optional comment lines beginning with #
 > -opt1 -opt2 arg1 arg2 # one line of command line args, executable will be prepended
 > <<<
 > 0 or more lines of input
 > >>> [/regexp/] [optional comment beginning with #]
 > [..or 0 or more lines of expected output]
 > >>>2 [/regexp/] [optional comment]
 > [..or 0 or more lines of expected error output]
 > >>>= [expected exit status or /regexp/] [optional comment]
 > # optional comment lines
 .
 The expected output and expected error output fields can have either a
 regular expression match expression, in which case the test passes if the
 output is matched, or 0 or more following data lines, in which case the
 output must match these exactly. The expected exit status field can have
 either a numeric exit code or a regular expression match expression. A !
 preceding a an exit code or \/regexp\/ negates the match. The regular
 expression syntax is that of the pcre-light library with the dotall flag.
 .
 The command line args field is required, all others are optional.  By
 default there is an implicit test for exit status = 0, but no implicit
 test for stdout or stderr.  You can change this with the
 -i/--implicit-tests flag.
 .
 Some issues to be aware of:
 .
 - uncompiled haskell scripts can't be tested due to http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/3890
 .
 - unparseable test files and uncompilable regexps are counted as test failures
