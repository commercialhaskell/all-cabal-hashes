name:           shelltestrunner
version:        0.6
x-revision: 1
category:       Testing
synopsis:       A tool for testing command-line programs.
description:
 .
 Run a given program through \"shell\" tests specifed by one or more test
 files, where each test can specify: command-line arguments, input, expected
 output, expected stderr output, and/or expected exit code.  This was
 extracted from the hledger project, inspired by the tests in John
 Wiegley's ledger project, and uses test-framework's test runner.
 .
 Usage:
 .
 > shelltestrunner [opts] executable testfile1 [testfile2 ...] [-- <test-framework runner opts>]
 .
 You can pass options through to test-framework's runner; they must go
 after -- at the end. You may be able to get a big speedup by running
 tests in parallel: try -- -j8.
 .
 Test file format:
 .
 A test file contains 0 or more shell tests, each of which looks like this:
 .
 > # 0 or more comment lines beginning with #
 > -opt1 -opt2 arg1 arg2 # one line of command line args, executable will be prepended
 > <<<
 > 0 or more lines of input
 > >>> [/regexp/]
 > [..or 0 or more lines of expected output]
 > >>>2 [/regexp/]
 > [..or 0 or more lines of expected error output]
 > >>>= [expected numeric exit code or /regexp/]
 .
 Each expected field can have either a regular expression match
 expression, in which case the test passes if the output is matched, or 0
 or more data lines, in which case the output must match these exactly.  A
 ! preceding a \/regexp\/ negates the match. The regular expression syntax
 is that supported by the regexpr library.
 .
 Apart from the command line, all fields are optional. Only the fields you
 specify will be tested, unless you use the -i/--implicit-tests flag,
 which adds default tests (empty stdout, empty stderr, and 0 exit code)
 for omitted fields.
 .
 Issues:
 .
 - can't test input/output which does not end with newline
 .
 - can't use / in regexps
 .
 - option processing and --help output could be better
 .
 Wishlist:
 .
 - configurable delimiters
