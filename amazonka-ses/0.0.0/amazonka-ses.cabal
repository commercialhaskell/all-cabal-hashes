description:
    Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) is a cost-effective
    outbound-only email-sending service built on the reliable and scalable
    infrastructure that Amazon.com has developed to serve its own customer
    base. With Amazon SES, you can send transactional email, marketing
    messages, or any other type of high-quality content and you only pay
    for what you use. Along with high deliverability, Amazon SES provides
    easy, real-time access to your sending statistics and built-in
    notifications for bounces, complaints, and deliveries to help you
    fine-tune your email-sending strategy.
