description:
  A configuration management library for programs and daemons.
  .
  Features include:
  .
  * Automatic, dynamic reloading in response to modifications to
    configuration files.
  .
  * A simple, but flexible, configuration language, supporting several
    of the most commonly needed types of data, along with
    interpolation of strings from the configuration or the system
    environment (e.g. @$(HOME)@).
  .
  * Subscription-based notification of changes to configuration
    properties.
  .
  * An @import@ directive allows the configuration of a complex
    application to be split across several smaller files, or common
    configuration data to be shared across several applications.
  .
  For details of the configuration file format, see
