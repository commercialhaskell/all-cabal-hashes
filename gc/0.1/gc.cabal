synopsis:      Poor Richard's Memory Manager
description:
  This package implements a form of <http://www.cs.canisius.edu/~hertzm/prmm-ismm-2011.pdf Poor Richard's Memory Manager>
  by Hertz, Kane, Keudel, Bai, Ding, Gu and Bard in user-space in GHC.
  .
  Usage:
  .
  > import System.Mem.Manager
  > main = do
  >   _ <- selfishManager
  >   ...
  .
  Now, the background thread that was spawned by @selfishManager@ will watch for signs that the host operating system
  is starting to cause the current process to page out to disk and respond with more aggressive garbage collection.
  .
  This empowers your code to try to avoid the inevitable death spiral that follows when GC has to happen with paged out data.
