synopsis:       A 2019 fork of an ncurses mp3 player written in Haskell
description:    An mp3 player with a curses frontend. Playlists are populated by

                ~/.hmp3db database. Type 'h' to display the help page.  Colours may
                be configured at runtime by editing the "~/.hmp3" file.
