name:           wordpress-auth
version:        1.0.0.1
synopsis:       Validate Wordpress Cookies & Nonces; Build Wordpress Hashes & Salts
description:    This package is used for validating Cookie data & Nonces from Wordpress.
                .
                You may find it useful if you're trying to serve a Haskell application alongside a Wordpress site. By validating the Cookies set by Wordpress, you can access the currently logged-in Wordpress user in Haskell without having to devise a Wordpress-to-Haskell authentication scheme.
                .
                It includes a generalized authentication function, as well as various helpers, validators, & hashers if you'd like to build a custom authentication process.
                .
                Servant users may want to just use the @servant-auth-wordpress@ package.
