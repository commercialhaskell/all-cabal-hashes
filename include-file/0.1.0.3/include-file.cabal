synopsis:            Inclusion of files in executables at compile-time.
description:         Inclusion of files in source code via Template Haskell.
                     .
                     When distributing executables, sometimes it is required
                     to attach some other resources in files. Using this library
                     (together with the TemplateHaskell extension) you avoid this
                     problem by including those files inside the executable at
                     compile time.
