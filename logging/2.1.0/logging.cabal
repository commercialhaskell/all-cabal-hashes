Description:
  @logging@ is a wrapper around @monad-logger@ and @fast-logger@ which makes
  it easy to log from any 'MonadLogger' environment, or from 'IO'.  It
  provides the following conveniences on top of those libraries:
  .
  - A 'MonadLogger' instance for 'IO'.  Usually this is bad for libraries, but
    can be very convenient for application writers who know they always want
    to log from IO to the console.  If you need to log to other sources, or to
    make logging compile-time optional, use @monad-logger@ directly.
  .
  - A set of shorter functions to type: 'debug', 'log', 'warn', plus others
    that flush after each message, or which allow providing a message source
    string.
  .
  - Logging variants of 'error', 'trace' and 'traceShow', called 'errorL',
    'traceL' and 'traceShowL'.  These use 'unsafePerformIO' in order to act as
    direct replacements, so the usual caveats apply.
  .
  - A global function, 'setDebugLevel', which uses a global 'IORef' to record
    the logging level, saving you from having to carry around the notion of
    "verbosity level" in a Reader environment.
  .
  - A set of "timed" variants, 'timedLog' and 'timedDebug', which report how
    long the specified action took to execute in wall-clock time.
