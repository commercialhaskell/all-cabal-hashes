synopsis:       Bindings to the JNI and a high level interface generator.
description:    This package offers bindings to the
                /Java Native Interface/ and a high level interface
                generator.
                .
                [@low level bindings to the JNI@]
                    The low level bindings are located in
                    "Foreign.Java.JNI.Safe" and "Foreign.Java.JNI.Unsafe".
                    When using these bindings you will have to deal with
                    pointers and manage global references manually.
                .
                [@medium level interface@]
                    The medium level interface is located in
                    "Foreign.Java". It offers an abstraction over the JNI,
                    i.e. you will not have to deal with pointers
                    explicitly nor do you need to manually do conversions
                    between native types and Haskell types.
                    Also references will automatically be released by
                    the Haskell runtime when no longer needed. You will
                    still need to manually lookup classes and methods in
                    order to use them.
                .
                .
                >>> INSTALLATION / USAGE
                .
                It should suffice to do @cabal install@ (or
                @cabal install java-bridge@ when installing from
                hackageDB). /You need to have a JDK installed prior to
                installing this library/.
                .
                Setup will try to find the location of your java
                installation automatically. This is needed in order to
                load @libjvm@. Note that this library is loaded
                dynamically, which  means that linking errors might not
                show up during installation.
                .
                You can specify the location of @libjvm@ manually using
                the environment variable @FFIJNI_LIBJVM@. This
                environment variable is consulted by @Setup.hs@ as well
                as by the library each time @libjvm@ is loaded - which
                means that you can override the path to @libjvm@ at any
                time. The function @getCompiledLibjvmPath@ in
                "Foreign.Java.JNI.Safe" will tell you what path to
                @libjvm@ has been set during compilation of the library.
                .
                .
                >>> FUN WITH (cabal-) FLAGS
                .
                The following cabal flags are available to you for
                configuring your installation:
                .
                [@ONLY_CORE@]
                    Build only the Core Modules which offer a
                    direct binding to the Java Native Interface.
                    The core modules are "Foreign.Java.JNI",
                    "Foreign.Java.JNI.Safe",
                    and "Foreign.Java.JNI.Unsafe".
                    This implies @NO_TOOLS@.
                    Defaults to @False@.
                .
                [@DEBUG@]
                    Enable a debug build. Defaults to @False@.
                .
                [@OSX_GUI@]
                    Build the library with special support for
                    Cocoa on Mac OS X (you will not be able to
                    use AWT or Swing without). Defaults to @True@
                    on Darwin (OS X).
                .
                [@OSX_FRAMEWORK@]
                    Use the JavaVM framework on MacOS X instead
                    of loading the dynamic library. Defaults to
                    @False@. Enable this flag if building on your
                    OS X machine fails. Defaults to @False@.
                .
                Use for example
                @cabal install -f OSX_FRAMEWORK -f EXAMPLES@
                or @cabal configure -f DEBUG@.
