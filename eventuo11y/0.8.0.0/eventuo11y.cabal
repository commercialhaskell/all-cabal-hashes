synopsis:           An event-oriented observability library
description:
  Instrument your Haskell codebase with wide, semantically meaningful events.
  This library is designed with separating the following concerns in mind:

  [@Writing instrumentation@] When instrumenting code, I want to think in terms of my
  application domain and report any information I might need to infer internal
  application-level state and understand the behavior of my program/library.

  [@Consuming instrumentation@] When consuming instrumentation, I want to think in
  terms of the API fo the specific backend I'm supporting (writing to @stderr@,
  serving a @Prometheus@ page, posting to @OpenTelemetry@) and what is needed to
  render to that API.

  [@Initializing instrumentation in an application@] When I'm ready to tie it all
  together, I want to identify the specific backends I want to post to and provide
  the bridge code to render the domain-specific instrumentation as needed for those
  backends. I also want to handle concerns like sampling or client-side aggregation
  of domain-specific instrumentation to keep usage manageable.

  See "Observe.Event" for detailed documentation on instrumenting your code.

  See "Observe.Event.Backend" for documentation on writing an
  @EventBackend@.

  See [eventuo11y-dsl](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/eventuo11y-dsl) for simpler syntax for
  creating application-level instrumentation types.

  See [eventuo11y-otel](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/eventuo11y-otel) for an OpenTelemetry-based
  backend.

  See [eventuo11y-json](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/eventuo11y-json) for JSON-based rendering
  and backends.

  See [Example.hs](https://github.com/shlevy/eventuo11y/tree/v0.6.0.0/Example.hs) for an example.

  See [eventuo11y-batteries](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/eventuo11y-batteries) for miscellaneous
  framework-specific helpers.
