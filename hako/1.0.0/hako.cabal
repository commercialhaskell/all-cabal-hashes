-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            A mako-like quasi-quoter template library

-- A longer description of the package.
Description:      A quasi-quote based HTML template library with a simplistic
                  approach, Hako borrows its philosophy from Mako, a popular
				  Python template library. The idea is that the template 
				  mechanism itself should be kept simple, while exposing the
				  full expressivity of Haskell itself inside the templates.
				  
				  At the same time, any value interpolated into a template gets
				  HTML-encoded by default, but you can override this behavior
				  by providing your own instances of the 'ToHtml' typeclass.
