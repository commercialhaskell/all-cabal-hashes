Synopsis:       retry statistics for STM transactions
Description:    This module provides functions that can replace calls to
                'atomically' and count how often the transaction was retried
                until it succeeded. It can emit warnings when transaction are
                retried more often than a given threshold, and provides global
                statistics across all transaction.
                .
                As an additional feature, if the transaction was named,
                transaction-related exceptions such as
                'BlockedIndefinitelyOnSTM' are replaced by variants that
                indicate which transaction caused the exception.
