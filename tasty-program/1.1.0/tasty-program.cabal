                     <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty tasty> testing
                     framework with capability to test whether an external

                     package by Adam Wick.

                     tasty-program provides basic functionality of
                     running a program with specified set of command
                     line parameters, and optionally a working
                     directory, and checking the exit code. Program's
                     output and error streams are ignored.
