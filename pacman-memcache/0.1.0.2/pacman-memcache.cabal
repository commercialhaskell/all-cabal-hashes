Name:                pacman-memcache
Version:             0.1.0.2
Synopsis:            Read whole Pacman database which pushes it into the memory cache
Description:         Read whole Pacman database which pushes it into the memory cache
 .
 Pacman is Linux package manager. It is used by Arch Linux.
 It's database is rather slow because it contains thousands of little files,
 which takes an enormous time to process.
 .
 The easiest way to speed up operations on database is force all those files into memory cache.
 This is the purpose of this program: it reads whole package database,
 where it will reside until kernel decides to remove this files from cache.
 .
 Three subsequent runs of pacman:
 .
 > pacman -Ss foo  0,37s user 0,66s system 2% cpu 41,459 total
 > pacman -Ss foo  0,16s user 0,08s system 98% cpu 0,238 total
 > pacman -Ss foo  0,15s user 0,08s system 97% cpu 0,237 total
 .
 Using pacman-memcache:
 .
 > pacman-memcache  1,11s user 0,53s system 6% cpu 26,312 total
 > pacman -Ss foo  0,15s user 0,09s system 19% cpu 1,260 total
 > pacman -Ss foo  0,15s user 0,08s system 97% cpu 0,235 total
 .
