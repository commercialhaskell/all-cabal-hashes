synopsis:            Helper functions for optparse-applicative.
description:
  The optparse-applicative package, as well as optparse-simple, has some
  undesirable behavior by default, and is quite verbose. This package exists to
  work around those two.
  .
  For instance:
  .
  * optparse-applicative does not show help on error by default.
  .
  * optparse-applicative does not disambiguate commands. So, if you have a
    command @my-executable foobar@, but your user runs @my-executable f@,
    optparse-applicative will not disambiguate this by default.
  .
  For more specific documentation, see the module documentation for
  "Options.Applicative.Helper".
