Name:         xcb-types
Version:      0.6.1
Cabal-Version:  >= 1.6
Synopsis:     Parses XML files used by the XCB project
Description:   This package provides types which mirror the structures
  used in the XCB code generation XML files.
  .
  See project http://xcb.freedesktop.org/ for more information about the XCB
  project.
  .
  The XML files describe the data-types, events and requests used by the
  X Protocol, and are used to auto-generate large parts of the XCB project.
  .
  This package parses these XML files into Haskell data structures.
  .
  If you want to do something with these XML descriptions but don't want
  to learn XSLT, this package should help.
  .
  This version of xcb-types is intended to fully parse the X Protocol
  description version 1.4.
