name:                phonetic-languages-phonetics-basics
version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            A library for working with generalized phonetic languages usage.
description:         There already exists a Ukrainian implementation for the phonetic languages approach published at: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/phonetic-languages-simplified-examples-array. It is optimized for the Ukrainian only and needs to be rewritten for every new language mostly from scratch using it as a template. To avoid this boilerplate, this one is provided. It can be used for different languages and even for music or other fields.
