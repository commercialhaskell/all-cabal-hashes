Name:                newtype-generics
Version:             0.4.0.1
x-revision: 1
Synopsis:            A typeclass and set of functions for working with newtypes, with generics support.
Description:         Per Conor McBride, the Newtype typeclass represents the packing and unpacking of a newtype,
                     and allows you to operatate under that newtype with functions such as ala.
                     Generics support was added in version 0.4, making this package a full replacement
                     for the original newtype package, and a better alternative to newtype-th.
