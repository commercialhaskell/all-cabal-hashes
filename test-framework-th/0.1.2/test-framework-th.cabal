description:
   @test-framework-th@ contains two interesting functions: @defaultMainGenerator@ and @testGroupGenerator@.
   .
   @defaultMainGenerator@ will extract all functions beginning with case_ or prop_ in the module and put them in a testGroup.
   .
   > module Foo where
   > main = $(defaultMainGenerator)
   >
   > case_Two = 2 @=? 2
   > case_Hi = "hi" @=? "hi"
   > prop_Reverse xs = reverse (reverse xs) == xs
   >  where types = xs :: [Int]
  .
  is the same as
  .
  > module Foo where
  > main = defaultMain [testGroup "Foo" [testProperty "Reverse" prop_Reverse, testCase "Two" case_Two, testCase "Hi" case_Hi]
  >
  > case_Two = 2 @=? 2
  > case_Hi = "hi" @=? "hi"
  > prop_Reverse xs = reverse (reverse xs) == xs
  >  where types = xs :: [Int]
  .
  @testGroupGenerator@ is like @defaultMainGenerator@ but without @defaultMain@. It is useful if you need a function for the testgroup
  (e.g. if you want to be able to call the testgroup from another module).
