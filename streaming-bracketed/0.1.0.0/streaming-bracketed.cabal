synopsis:            A resource management decorator for "streaming".        
description:         This package provides a decorator for the Stream type from
                     the "streaming" package, that lets you perform bracket-like 
                     operations that allocate and deallocate resources used 
                     by the stream.
                     .
                     By carefully managing the operations that are lifted to
                     the bracketed streams, we can ensure that finalizers are
                     promptly called even with operations like "take", which do
                     not consume the whole stream.
