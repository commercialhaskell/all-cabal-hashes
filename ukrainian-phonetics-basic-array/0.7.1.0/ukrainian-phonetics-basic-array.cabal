name:                ukrainian-phonetics-basic-array
version:             0.7.1.0
synopsis:            A library to work with the basic Ukrainian phonetics and syllable segmentation.
description:         Rewritten from the mmsyn6ukr and mmsyn7s packages. Comparing to the ukrainian-phonetics-basic package, all the vector-related functionality removed, it also removed from the dependencies and the mmsyn2 is changed to mmsyn2-array. Since 0.4.0.0 version switched to the more optimized Int8-based functionality. The old modules with bytestring dependencies since the 0.6.0.0 version moved to the other package ukrainian-phonetics-basic-array-bytestring to reduce the actual dependencies for the phonetic languages concerning packages.
