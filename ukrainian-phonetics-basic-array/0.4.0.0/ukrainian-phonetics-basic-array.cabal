version:             0.4.0.0
synopsis:            A library to work with the basic Ukrainian phonetics and syllable segmentation.
description:         A library to work with the basic Ukrainian phonetics and syllable segmentation. Rewritten from the mmsyn6ukr and mmsyn7s packages. Comparing to the ukrainian-phonetics-basic package, all the vector-related functionality removed, it also removed from the dependencies and the mmsyn2 is changed to mmsyn2-array. Since 0.4.0.0 version switched to the more optimized Int8-based functionality. The modules that do not use Int8 after ugrading the phonetic-languages-simplified-examples-array to the Int8-based functionality are planned to be moved to the new package.
