description:
    AWS Import/Export accelerates moving large amounts of data into and out
    of AWS using portable storage devices for transport. AWS transfers your
    data directly onto and off of storage devices using Amazonâ€™s high-speed
    internal network and bypassing the Internet. For significant data sets,
    AWS Import/Export is often faster than Internet transfer and more cost
    effective than upgrading your connectivity.
