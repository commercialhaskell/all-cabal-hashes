Name:               data-reify
Version:            0.1
Synopsis:           Reify a recursive data structure into an explicit graph.
Description:	    'data-reify' provided the ability to turn recursive structures into explicit graphs. 
		    Many (implicitly or explicitly) recursive data structure can be given this ability, via
		    a type class instance. This gives an alternative to using 'Ref' for observable sharing.
		    .
		    Observable sharing in general is unsafe (hence the module path name Data.Unsafe.Reify), 
		    but can be used safely if some simple conditions are met.
		    Typically this package will be used to tie the knot with DSL's that depend of
		    observable sharing, like Lava.
 		    .
		    Providing an instance for 'MuRef' is the mechanism for allowing a structure to be 
		    reified into a graph, and four examples of this are provided.
		    .
