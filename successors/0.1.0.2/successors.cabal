synopsis: An applicative functor to manage successors
description:
    This package provides the
    'Control.Applicative.Successors.Succs' functor. It models
    a node in a graph together with its successors. The
    @Applicative@ (and @Monad@) instances are designed so that
    the successors of the resulting value take exactly one
    step, either in the left or the right argument to @\<*\>@
    (or @>>=@).
