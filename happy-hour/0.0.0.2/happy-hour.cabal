synopsis: Generate simple okay-looking bar plots without much effort

description:
    The purpose of this library is to generate okay-looking bar plots
    for you without much effort on your part. The style of the plots
    may change in newer releases as we find ways to make them look
    nicer. If happy-hour generates a plot for you that is not
    aesthetically pleasing, please let us know so that we may improve.

tested-with: GHC==8.6.3, GHC==8.8.4
