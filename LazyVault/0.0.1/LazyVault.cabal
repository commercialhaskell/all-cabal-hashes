description:         LazyVault is a sandboxing tool to install libraries and executables with a sandboxed environment. At the moment it's only supported under Unix or Gnu Systems. This package has only been tested under Gnu/Linux however. This program creates cabal sandboxes which you can use globally. For a detailed explaination on how this works refer to the README file found on the github page.
