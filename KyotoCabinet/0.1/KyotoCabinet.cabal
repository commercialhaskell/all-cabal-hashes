synopsis: Kyoto Cabinet DB bindings
description:
    Kyoto Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a
    database. The database is a simple data file containing records,
    each is a pair of a key and a value. Every key and value is serial
    bytes with variable length. Both binary data and character string
    can be used as a key and a value. Each key must be unique within a
    database. There is neither concept of data tables nor data
    types. Records are organized in hash table or B+ tree.
    .
    Kyoto Cabinet runs very fast. For example, elapsed time to store
    one million records is 0.9 seconds for hash database, and 1.1
    seconds for B+ tree database. Moreover, the size of database is
    very small. For example, overhead for a record is 16 bytes for
    hash database, and 4 bytes for B+ tree database. Furthermore,
    scalability of Kyoto Cabinet is great. The database size can be up
    to 8EB (9.22e18 bytes).
    .
    Kyoto Cabinet is written in the C++ language, and provided as API
    of C++, C, Java, Python, Ruby, Perl, Lua and Haskell. Kyoto Cabinet is
    available on platforms which have API conforming to C++03 with the
    TR1 library extensions. Kyoto Cabinet is a free software licensed
    under the GNU General Public License. On the other hand, a
    commercial license is also provided. If you use Kyoto Cabinet
    within a proprietary software, the commercial license is required.
