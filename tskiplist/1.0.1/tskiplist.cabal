name:           tskiplist
version:        1.0.1
synopsis:       A Skip List Implementation in Software Transactional Memory (STM)
description:    This package provides a proof-of-concept implementation of a skip list in STM. A skip list is a probabilistic data structure with dictionary operations and support for efficient range-queries (similarly to Data.Map). In contrast to tree data structures, a skip list does not need any rebalancing, which makes it particularly suitable for concurrent programming. (See: William Pugh. Skip Lists: A Probabilistic Alternative to Balanced Trees.)
