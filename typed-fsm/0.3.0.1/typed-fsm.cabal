cabal-version:      3.0
-- The cabal-version field refers to the version of the .cabal specification,
-- and can be different from the cabal-install (the tool) version and the

-- version used must be equal or greater than the version stated in this field.
-- Starting from the specification version 2.2, the cabal-version field must be
-- the first thing in the cabal file.

-- Initial package description 'typed-fsm' generated by

-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis: A framework for strongly typed FSM

-- A longer description of the package.
description:
  FSM stands for [Finite State Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine).
  The typed-fsm is used to define and execute FSM.

  Advantages of type-fsm:

  * Focus on the right message.
  * Top-to-bottom design for easy refactoring.
  * Conducive to building complex state machine systems:
  ** Type guarantees will not produce incorrect function calls when written.
  ** With the help of the type system, we can define many state processing functions and then call each other recursively with confidence.
  * There is a sanity check. If you miss some items for pattern matching, the compiler will issue a warning, and there will also be a warning for invalid items.
