name:           unescaping-print
version:        0.1
synopsis:       Tiny package providing unescaping versions of show and print
description:    This package solves the problem of escaping all "non-printable" symbols by the standard `show` function. It provides the `ushow` and `uprint` functions which replace `show` and `print` from `Prelude`. The function `uprint` is intended to be used as custom printing function in GHCi (with the `-interactive-print` option).
