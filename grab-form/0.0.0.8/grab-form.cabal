description:
    @Grab@ is an @Applicative@ for consuming lists of
    (name, value) parameters.

    == Example

    Parser:

    > nameStateAndQAs :: Grab EnglishSentence (Text, Text, [QA])
    > nameStateAndQAs =
    >     (,,)
    >         <$> at "name" (only text)
    >         <*> at "state" (only text)
    >         <*> at "security" (only (natList (only qa)))
    >
    > qa :: Grab EnglishSentence QA
    > qa =
    >     QA
    >         <$> at "Q" (only text)
    >         <*> at "A" (only text)

    Input:

    > name:           Alonzo
    > state:          Montana
    > security[1].Q:  What is your favorite hobby?
    > security[1].A:  watching cars
    > security[2].Q:  What is your oldest sibling's name?
    > security[2].A:  melman
    > security[3].Q:  What was the make and model of your first car?
    > security[3].A:  bmw x5

    Output:

    > ( "Alonzo"
    > , "Montana"
    > , [ QA
    >       { qa_question = "What is your favorite hobby?"
    >       , qa_answer = "watching cars"
    >       }
    >   , QA
    >       { qa_question = "What is your oldest sibling's name?"
    >       , qa_answer = "melman"
    >       }
    >   , QA
    >       { qa_question = "What was the make and model of your first car?"
    >       , qa_answer = "bmw x5"
    >       }
    >   ]
    > )
