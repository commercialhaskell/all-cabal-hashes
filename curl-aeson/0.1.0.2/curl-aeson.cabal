synopsis:            Communicate with web services using JSON 
description:         A library for communicating with JSON over HTTP(S)
                     or any other protocols supported by cURL.
                     .
                     Supports rich set of connectivity
                     features provided by libcurl combined to the
                     performance and elegancy of aeson.
                     .
                     All HTTP methods are supported. Instances of 'ToJSON'
                     and 'FromJSON' typeclasses can be transferred via
                     this library. Session cookies and other HTTP options
                     may be passed to libcurl if needed.
                     .
                     This library is at its best when communicating with
                     simple, non-standardized JSON interfaces. If you are
                     implementing JSON-RPC compliant client or server,
                     take a look at
                     <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/jmacro-rpc>.
