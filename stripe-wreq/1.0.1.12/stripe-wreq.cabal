category: Web

description:
    This package helps you make requests to the
    <https://stripe.com/ Stripe> API in conjunction with
    the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wreq wreq> package.
    This is a minimal library that makes no attempt obscure
    either its underpinnings in Wreq or any of the details of the
    Stripe API. Responses are returned as
    <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson aeson> values.
