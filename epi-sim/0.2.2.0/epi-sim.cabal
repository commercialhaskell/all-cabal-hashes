synopsis:       A library for simulating epidemics as birth-death processes.
description:
  A library for simulating epidemics, with a focus on phylodynamics and
  observation models.
  .
  /Available models/
  .
  * Birth-Death (see `Epidemic.BirthDeath`)
  .
  * Birth-Death-Sampling (see `Epidemic.BirthDeathSampling`)
  .
  * Birth-Death-Sampling-Occurrence (see `Epidemic.BirthDeathSamplingOccurrence`)
  .
  * Birth-Death-Sampling-Catastrophe-Occurrence (see `Epidemic.BirthDeathSamplingCatastropheOccurrence`)
  .
  * Birth-Death-Sampling-Catastrophe-Occurrence-Disaster (see `Epidemic.BDSCOD`)
  .
  * Inhomogeneous Birth-Death (see `Epidemic.InhomogeneousBD`)
  .
  * Inhomogeneous Birth-Death-Sampling (see `Epidemic.InhomogeneousBDS`)
  .
  /Output format/
  .
  The output is a CSV with a header encoding which events occurred when and to
  whom: @event,time,primaryPerson,secondaryPerson@. The @primary person@ is either
  the infecting person or the person who has been removed in some manner, the
  @secondary person@ is the person who was infected, or this is a missing value.
  There are functions to assist in extracting observations from a full simulation:
  @birthDeathSamplingOccurrenceObservedEvents@. In the case of a catastrophe event
  where multiple individuals may be removed, they are represented as a colon
  separated list of identifiers in the @primaryPerson@ field.
