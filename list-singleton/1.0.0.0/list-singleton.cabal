name: list-singleton
version: 1.0.0.0
synopsis: Easily and clearly create lists with only one element in them.
description:
  The @list-singleton@ package allows you to easily and clearly create lists
  with only one element in them, which are typically called "singleton lists"
  or simply "singletons". (Not to be confused with
  the [@singletons@](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/singletons) package!)
  .
  With any luck this library will be included in future versions of
  the [@base@](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base) package. See this
  mailing list thread for an extended discussion:
  <https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/libraries/2019-August/029801.html>.
