synopsis:            Flexible manual resource management
description:
  The lifetimes package provides support for manual resource management,
  in a way that is more flexible than what is provided by @resourcet@ or
  @bracket@.
  .
  Like @resourcet@, this package allows releasing acquired resources early.
  In addition, it also provides move semantics: resources can be moved to
  a different lifetime after they are acquired. Lifetimes are first class
  values, which can themselves be acquired as resources, allowing for
  heirarchical management as well.
