name:                string-like
version:             0.1.0.1
synopsis: A package that aims to provide a uniform interface to string-like types.
description:
  The package defines a typeclass that can be implemented to provide a uniform interface for @String@-like objects.
  .
  The typeclass itself has default implementations that convert the @StringLike@
  item first to a lazy @Text@, then performs the operation, and converts results back to
  its @StringLike@ object. This is usually /not/ as efficient as an operation for
  that specific type. Therefore it is advisable to implement the other functions as well.
  One can however decide to only implement @fromText@ and @toText@; or @toString@.
