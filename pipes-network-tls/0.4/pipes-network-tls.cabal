description:
  Use TLS-secured network connections together with the @pipes@ ecosystem.
  .
  This package is organized using the following namespaces:
  .
  * "Pipes.Network.TCP.TLS" exports pipes and utilities for using
  TLS-secured TCP connections in a streaming fashion.
  .
  * "Pipes.Network.TCP.TLS.Safe" subsumes "Pipes.Network.TCP.TLS",
  exporting pipes and functions that allow you to safely establish new
  TCP connections within a pipeline using the @pipes-safe@ facilities.
  You only need to use this module if you want to acquire and release
  operating system resources within a pipeline.
  .
  See the @changelog@ file in the source distribution to learn about any
  important changes between version.
