synopsis: Haskell implementation of the xorshift random generator.
description: The Xorshift random generator is a very fast generator that uses
    only XOR and bitshifting operations. This package contains a basic version
    with a periode of 2^32-1 for 32-bit numbers and a version with a periode of
    2^64-1 for 64-bit numbers.
    .
    Although the author didn't tested the random generator,
    but according to it's specification the resulting numbers are of good
    quality.
