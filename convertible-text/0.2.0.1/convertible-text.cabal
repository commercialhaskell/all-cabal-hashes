synopsis: Typeclasses and instances for converting between types
Description:
 This is a port of John Goerzen's convertible package, intended to distinguish between conversions which are guaranteed to succeed and those which might fail.  It uses the attempt package, which in turn uses the failure package, so that this package is fully compatible with the failure framework.
 .
 This package currently contains all of the typeclasses and instances for convertible.  However, as these features are ported to the convertible package, this package will be left with only the instances for converting to and from text types (String, ByteString (lazy and strict) and Text (lazy and strict).
 .
 Be aware that conversions to and from bytestrings assume UTF-8 encoding. If a different encoding is desired, you can use a newtype wrapper and declare an instance of @ConvertAttempt@ or @ConvertSuccess@ on it.
 .
 The main module to import is "Data.Convertible.Text".
