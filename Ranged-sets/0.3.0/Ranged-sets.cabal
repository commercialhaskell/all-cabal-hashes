synopsis: Ranged sets for Haskell
description: A ranged set is an ordered list of ranges.  This allows sets such as all reals x such that:
             .
             > (0.25 < x <= 0.75 or 1.4 <= x < 2.3 or 4.5 < x)
             .
             Alternatively you can have all strings s such that:
             .
             >    ("F" <= s < "G")
