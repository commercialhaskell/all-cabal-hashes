description: 
  Have you ever heard of [Turtle Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics)?

  If not, then think of a @turtle@ as a cursor you can program to draw! 

  Turtle graphics are a fantastic introduction to the world of
    programming and to the syntax of a new programming language.

  ![parallelcircles gif](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/worldturtle-0.2.0.0/docs/docs/images/parallel_circles_animated_300.gif)

  This module is a framework built on top 
  of [gloss](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss) to render turtles
  programmed in Haskell as animations. This is primarily aimed as a 
  teaching tool to beginners - but also, it's cool to draw things!

  See The API ref, "Graphics.WorldTurtle", for features!

  It's easy to create a new project with stack:

  > stack new my-worldturtle-project aneilmac/worldturtle
  > cd my-worldturtle-project
  > stack build
  > stack exec my-worldturtle-project
