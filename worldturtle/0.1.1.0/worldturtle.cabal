description: 
  Have you ever heard of [Turtle Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics)?
  .
  If not, then think of a @turtle@ as a cursor you can program to draw! 
  .
  Turtle graphics are a fantastic introduction to the world of
    programming and to the syntax of a new programming language.
  .

  .
  This module is a framework built on top 
  of [gloss](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gloss) to render turtles
  programmed in Haskell as animations. This is primarily aimed as a 
  teaching tool to beginners - but also, it's cool to draw things!
  .
  See The API ref, "Graphics.WorldTurtle", for features!
