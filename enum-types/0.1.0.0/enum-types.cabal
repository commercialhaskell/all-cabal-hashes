description:
  This library provides small enumeration types intended to be
  used in test suites. This is most useful when used with a companion
  package that provides orphan instances:
  .
  * quickcheck-enum-instances
  .
  * leancheck-enum-instances
  .
  The value these types provide is that they allow the user to
  be selective about the number of inhabitants a tested type should
  have.
