name:                zero
version:             0.1.5
synopsis:            Semigroups with absorption
description:         'Monoid' is a 'Semigroup' glued with a neutral element
                     called 'mempty'. In the same idea, 'Zero' is a 'Semigroup'
                     glued with an absorbing element called 'zero'.
                     .
                     Keep in mind that 'Zero' requires 'Semigroup'. If you have
                     'Semigroup' defined to work with 'Monoid', you might end up
                     with no way to implement 'Zero'. Thatâ€™s why the 'Semigroup'
                     instance for 'Maybe' is confusing, because it relies on
                     'Monoid', and cannot be used with 'Zero'. 'Success' is the
                     'Zero' equivalent of 'Maybe' + 'Monoid'.
