description:
    Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fast, reliable, scalable, fully
    managed message queuing service. SQS makes it simple and cost-effective
    to decouple the components of a cloud application. You can use SQS to
    transmit any volume of data, at any level of throughput, without losing
    messages or requiring other services to be always available. With SQS,
    you can offload the administrative burden of operating and scaling a
    highly available messaging cluster, while paying a low price for only
    what you use.
    .

    /Warning:/ This is an experimental preview release which is still under
    heavy development and not intended for public consumption, caveat emptor!
