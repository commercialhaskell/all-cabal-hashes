    AWS IoT (Beta)

    __AWS IoT is in beta and is subject to change__

    AWS IoT provides secure, bi-directional communication between
    Internet-connected things (such as sensors, actuators, embedded devices,
    or smart appliances) and the AWS cloud. You can discover your custom
    IoT-Data endpoint to communicate with, configure rules for data
    processing and integration with other services, organize resources
    associated with each thing (Thing Registry), configure logging, and
    create and manage policies and credentials to authenticate things.

    For more information about how AWS IoT works, see the
    <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/aws-iot-how-it-works.html Developer Guide>.
    .
    The types from this library are intended to be used with
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides
    mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.
    .
    Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
    This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
    de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
    The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
    such as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.
    .
    See "Network.AWS.IoT" and the <https://aws.amazon.com/iot AWS API Reference>
    to get started.
