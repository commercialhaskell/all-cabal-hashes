synopsis:            Make functions consume Proxy instead of undefined
description:         @proxied@ is a simple library that exports a function to
                     convert constant functions to ones that take a @proxy@
                     value in the "Data.Proxied" module. This is useful for
                     retrofiting typeclasses that have functions that return a
                     constant value for any value of a particular type (but
                     still need to consume some value, since one of the
                     parameterized types must appear in a typeclass function).
                     Often, these functions are given @undefined@ as an
                     argument, which might be considered poor design.
                     .
                     @Proxy@, however, does not carry any of the
                     error-throwing risks of @undefined@, so it is much more
                     preferable to take @Proxy@ as an argument to a constant
                     function instead of @undefined@. Unfortunately, @Proxy@
                     was included in @base@ until GHC 7.8, so many of @base@'s
                     typeclasses still contain constant functions that aren't
                     amenable to passing @Proxy@. @proxied@ addresses this
                     issue by providing variants of those typeclass functions
                     that take an explicit @proxy@ value.
                     .
                     This library also contains the "Data.Proxyless" module,
                     which works in the opposite direction. That is, one can
                     take functions which take @Proxy@ (or @undefined@) as an
                     argument and convert them to functions which take no
                     arguments. This trick relies on the @-XTypeApplications@
                     extension, so it is only available with GHC 8.0 or later.
