Synopsis:           Closable, fair, single-wakeup channel type that avoids 0
                    reader space leaks.

Description:
    __WARNING:__ While the code in this library should be fairly stable and
    production, the API is something I'm still working on. API changes will
    follow the PVP, but __expect__ breaking API changes in future versions!
    .
    A closable, fair, single-wakeup channel that avoids the 0 reader space leak
    that @"Control.Concurrent.Chan"@ from base suffers from.
    .
    The @Chan@ type from @"Control.Concurrent.Chan"@ consists of both a read
    and write end combined into a single value. This means there is always at
    least 1 read end for a @Chan@, which keeps any values written to it alive.
    This is a problem for applications/libraries that want to have a channel
    that can have zero listeners.
    .
    Suppose we have an library that produces events and we want to let users
    register to receive events. If we use a channel and write all events to it,
    we would like to drop and garbage collect any events that take place when
    there are 0 listeners. The always present read end of @Chan@ from base
    makes this impossible. We end up with a @Chan@ that forever accumulates
    more and more events that will never get removed, resulting in a memory
    leak.
    .
    @"BroadcastChan"@ splits channels into separate read and write ends. Any
    message written to a a channel with no existing read end is immediately
    dropped so it can be garbage collected. Once a read end is created, all
    messages written to the channel will be accessible to that read end.
    .
    Once all read ends for a channel have disappeared and been garbage
    collected, the channel will return to dropping messages as soon as they are
    written.
    .
    __Why should I use "BroadcastChan" over "Control.Concurrent.Chan"?__
    .
    * @"BroadcastChan"@ is closable,
    .
    * @"BroadcastChan"@ has no 0 reader space leak,
    .
    * @"BroadcastChan"@ has comparable or better performance.
    .
    __Why should I use "BroadcastChan" over various (closable) STM channels?__
    .
    * @"BroadcastChan"@ is single-wakeup,
    .
    * @"BroadcastChan"@ is fair,
    .
    * @"BroadcastChan"@ performs better under contention.
