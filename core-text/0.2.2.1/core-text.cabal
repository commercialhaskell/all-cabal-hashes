synopsis: A rope type based on a finger tree over UTF-8 fragments
description:
    A rope data type for text, built as a finger tree over UTF-8 text
    fragments. The package also includes utiltiy functions for breaking and
    re-wrapping lines, conveniences for pretty printing and colourizing
    terminal output, and a simple mechanism for multi-line Rope literals.
    .
    The main @Rope@ type and its usage are described at "Core.Text.Rope" in
    this package.
    .
    This is part of a library intended to ease interoperability and assist in
    building command-line programs, both tools and longer-running daemons.
    A list of features and some background to the library's design is contained
    in the
    <https://github.com/oprdyn/unbeliever/blob/master/README.markdown README>
    on GitHub.
