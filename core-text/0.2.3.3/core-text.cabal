version:        0.2.3.3
synopsis:       A rope type based on a finger tree over UTF-8 fragments
description:    A rope data type for text, built as a finger tree over UTF-8 text
                fragments. The package also includes utiltiy functions for breaking and
                re-wrapping lines, conveniences for pretty printing and colourizing
                terminal output, and a simple mechanism for multi-line Rope literals.
                .
                The main @Rope@ type and its usage are described at "Core.Text.Rope" in
                this package.
                .
                This is part of a library intended to ease interoperability and assist in
                building command-line programs, both tools and longer-running daemons.
                A list of features and some background to the library's design is contained
                in the
