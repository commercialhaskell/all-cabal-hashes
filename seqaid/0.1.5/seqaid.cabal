synopsis:            Dynamic strictness control, including space leak repair
description:         Seqaid is a GHC plugin for non-invasive auto-instrumentation of dynamic strictness (and parallelism) control, shortly to include optimisation for automated space leak relief using minimal strictification. [The optimiser is still in development however.]
                     .
                     Refer to the seqaid <http://www.fremissant.net/seqaid homepage> for more information.

-- XXX
-- A few of the latest flags are not used very consistently,
-- and there are probably bugs related:
--   ONLY_TOP_LEVEL_INJECTIONS
--   INFER_TOP_LEVEL_TYPES
--   SEQAIDPP_TYPES
--  (DEMO_MODE)
--  (... the rest, basically! ...)

-- There were about twice as many flags, so I've done what I can,
-- but not ready to throw away the alternative code branches
-- for the remaining yet.  In a few minor version bumps, will
-- probably have done away with most of the rest.

Flag TRY_INJECT_NOINLINE_ON_REQUESTED_BINDS
  Description: If we can prevent inling of injected binds (without requiring user edits), that would probably be a good trade off in terms of lost optimiser oppportunities in exchange for assurance that the bind won't be inlined. This didn't work, and is a poor solution anyway.
--Default:     True
  Default:     False

Flag SEQABLE_ONLY
  Description: Like NFDATAN_ONLY, but for newer Seqable module.
--Default:     True
  Default:     False

Flag TH_TYPE_IN_TYPES_ANN
  Description: Actually this is just preparatory, haven't gone down this road far yet. (We would like a TH.Type to Type.Type conversion function in the GHC API. Then we'd just send the list of Type.Type for direct use by the Core-plugin downstream).
--Default:     True
  Default:     False

Flag SEQAIDPP_TYPES
  Description: Rather than choose types to seqinj for based on the types of the top-level binds, use seqaidpp to parse the types from seqaid.config. This stays on perpetually, finally, and could be removed soon.
  Default:     True
--Default:     False

-- Flag ONLY_TOP_LEVEL_INJECTIONS
--   Description: Like it says; as opposed to descending to (potentially) wrap subexpressions ... the latter which has just become possible due to seqaidpp.
-- --Default:     True
--   Default:     False

Flag INFER_TOP_LEVEL_TYPES
  Description: If True, then TH/modulespection will be used as it has been, to blanket-inject all top-level functions (at least, those not explicitly or implicitly excluded). Now, if False, only RHS's with result types in the "types" list for the module (in seqaid.config) will be wrapped (again, at least those not explicitly or implicitly excluded).
--Default:     True
  Default:     False

Flag DEMO_MODE
  Description: This is the only working mode in the first release. (And it only works when tested on the "leaky" package.) The switch exists to exclude hashable/hashtables deps (and subdeps) from the first release, while I can continue to work on this aspect in the development head.
  Default:     True
--Default:     False

Flag DBG_SEQAID
  Description: When set, every call to seqaidDispatch emits a line of info.
  Default:     True
--Default:     False

Flag NO_TOP_LEVEL_SEQINJ_DUMMIES
  Description: If have to inject a class and instance anyway to evade DCE, no need for the old top-level seqinj_ declarations (we hope...).
--Default:     True
  Default:     False

Flag NFDATAN_ONLY
  Description: To simplify debugging.
--Default:     True
  Default:     False

-- This only applies to NFDATAN_ONLY, since NFDataP has Typeable as
-- a superclass already. (The point is, you can set this False, and
-- get rid of as much class/instance cruft as possible in the Core,
-- for help debugging.)
Flag SHOW_TYPE
  Description: Include Typeable instance for (show . typeOf) in seqaidDispatch
  Default:     True
--Default:     False
