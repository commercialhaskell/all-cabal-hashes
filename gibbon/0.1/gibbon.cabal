synopsis:           A compiler for operating on serialized trees.
description:        Gibbon is an experimental compiler that transforms
                    high-level functional programs to operate on serialized
                    data.
                    .
                    Typically, programs that process tree-like data
                    represent trees using pointer-based data structures in
                    memory (one heap object per-leaf and per-node) because such
                    a layout is convenient to manipulate in a high-level
                    programming language. This is also generally distinct from
                    the representation of the data in serialized form on disk,
                    which means that a program must perform some sort or
                    marshaling when working with serialized data.
                    Gibbon unifies the in-memory and serialized formats,
                    transforming recursive functions to operate directly on
                    serialized data.
                    .
                    Additionally, while the pointer-based structure is efficient
                    for random access and shape-changing modifications,
                    it can be inefficient for traversals that process most or
                    all of a tree in bulk. The Gibbon project aims to explore
                    optimizations of recursive tree transforms by changing how
                    trees are stored in memory.
