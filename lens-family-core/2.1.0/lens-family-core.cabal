description:        This package provides first class(†) functional references in Van Laarhoven style supporting the following optics:
                    .
                    * Lenses (view, over)
                    .
                    * Traversals (toListOf, matching, over)
                    .
                    * Setters (over)
                    .
                    * Grates (zipWithOf, under, review)
                    .
                    * Resetters (under)
                    .
                    * Adapters (view, review)
                    .
                    * Grids (toListOf, over / under, review)
                    .
                    * Prisms (matching, over / under, review)
                    .
                    * Getters (view)
                    .
                    * Folders (toListOf)
                    .
                    * Reviewers (review)
                    .
                    (†) For optimal first-class support use the @lens-family@ package with rank 2 / rank N polymorphism.
                    "Lens.Family.Clone" allows for first-class support of lenses and traversals for those who cannot support rank 2 polymorphism.
