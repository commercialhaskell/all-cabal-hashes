description:        This package provides first class(†) functional references.
                    In addition to the usual operations of getting, setting and composition, plus integration with the state monad, lens families provide some unique features:
                    .
                    * Polymorphic updating
                    .
                    * Traversals
                    .
                    * Cast projection functions to read-only lenses
                    .
                    * Cast \"toList\" functions to read-only traversals
                    .
                    * Cast semantic editor combinators to modify-only traversals.
                    .
                    (†) For optimal first-class support use the @lens-family@ package with rank 2 / rank N polymorphism.
                    "Lens.Family.Clone" allows for first-class support of lenses and traversals for those who require Haskell 98.
