synopsis: reversed lists/snoc lists
description: The key idea of this library is to leverage the type system to control the performance characteristics of list-manipulation code.
  It defines the type `RList`, which is a snoc-list rather than a cons-list.
  It also creates a symmetric module for cons-lists, which focuses on the efficient and safe use of linked lists.
  See README.md for more information.
