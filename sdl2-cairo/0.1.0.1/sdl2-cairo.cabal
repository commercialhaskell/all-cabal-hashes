name:                sdl2-cairo
version:             0.1.0.1
synopsis:            Binding to render with Cairo on SDL textures
                     and optional convenience drawing API.
description:         This small library provides convenience functions to draw
                     on SDL2 textures with Cairo. As Cairo is complicated, it also
                     provides a drawing API, which is heavily inspired by Processing and
                     is much more user-friendly. If it does not support something,
                     you can always embed direct Cairo commands, so you do not have
                     to decide!
