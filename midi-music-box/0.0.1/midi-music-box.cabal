Name:                midi-music-box
Version:             0.0.1
Synopsis:            Convert MIDI file to music box punch tape
Description:
  Convert MIDI file to music box punch tape for this kind of music box:
  <http://www.amazon.de/Spieluhr-Lochstreifen/dp/B001WNZOVO/>
  .
  Run it like so:
  .
  > midi-music-box --output=song.ps song.mid
  .
  @song.mid@ is the input file that must be a MIDI file.
  @song.ps@ is the output file, a PostScript file.
  You can print it with a printer or to a PDF document
  or convert it to many other formats.
  Currently, the output file must always have the @.ps@ filename extension.
  Other formats could be supported by adding more of the @diagrams-*@ packages.
  However, this means you have to alter the program.
  .
  The program will print the following symbols to the stripe:
  .
  * blue dot - correct note that should be punched
  .
  * # - this is a semitone and cannot be played accurately
    (at least on the type of music box I refered to, above)
  .
  * ! - the note is outside the range
  .
  In case of notes outside the stripe you have to adapt the offset.
  You may write
  .
  > midi-music-box --zerokey=72 --output=song.ps song.mid
  .
  in order to make the MIDI note with number 72
  the left-most note on the stripe.
  Default is @--zerokey=60@.
  The number of notes in an octave is 12.
  If you use a zerokey that is a multiple of 12
  then white (piano) keys remain white, and black keys remain black,
  so to speak.
  If zerokey is not a multiple of 12
  then white keys may become black an vice versa.
  Since the music box type considered here only supports white keys,
  I recommend the following:
  If the song is in key X major then lookup the MIDI note number for X
  and choose X plus or minus a multiple of 12 as zerokey.
  If the song has key Y minor, then X=Y+3.
