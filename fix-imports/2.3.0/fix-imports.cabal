synopsis: Program to manage the imports of a haskell module
description:
    `fix-imports` is a small standalone program to manage the import block of
    a haskell program.  It will try to add import lines for qualified names
    with no corresponding import, remove unused import lines, and keep the
    import block sorted, with optional rules for grouping.
    .
    Support for unqualified imports is limited to symbols you explicitly
    configure, so if you list `System.FilePath.(</>)`, it will add that import
    when you use it, or remove when it's no longer used, but it won't go search
    modules for unqualified imports.
    .
    It doesn't mess with non-managed unqualified imports, so you can still use
    unqualified imports, you just have to do it manually.
    .
    Since it's a unix-style filter, it should be possible to integrate into any
    editor.  There's an example vimrc to bind to a key in vim.
