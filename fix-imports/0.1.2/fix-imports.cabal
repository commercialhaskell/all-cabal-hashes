synopsis: Program to manage the imports of a haskell module
description:
    A small standalone program to manage the import block of a haskell program.
    It will try to add import lines for qualified names with no corresponding
    import, remove unused import lines, and sort the import block according to
    some heuristic you can define.  This only works for qualified imports!
    Unqualified imports are left untouched.
    .
    It's most convenient if bound to an editor key.
