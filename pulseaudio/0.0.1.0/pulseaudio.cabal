-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:            A low-level (incomplete) wrapper around the pulseaudio client asynchronous api

-- A longer description of the package.
description:         
  This package mainly exists, because I wanted to query the current system
  volume from the pulse audio server.
  .
  Doing this required me to build at least the core of the pulse api.
  .
  This package is provided as is, with very little testing and only a small
  subset of the pulse api implemented.
  Expanding this package *should* be rather easy. At least for query/control.
  If you are interested in doing this, but don't know how, feel free to contact me.
  .
  .
  In package is a bit unrefined and rough. If you have better structure for
  modules feel free to reorganize them and making a PR. This also means, don't
  see this structur as fixed yet, it may change if someone has a better idea.
