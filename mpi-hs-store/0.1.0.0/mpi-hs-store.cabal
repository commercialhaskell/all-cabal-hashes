synopsis:       MPI bindings for Haskell
description:    MPI (the [Message Passinag Interface](https://www.mpi-forum.org)) is
                a widely used standard for distributed-memory programming on HPC
                (High Performance Computing) systems. MPI allows exchanging data
                (_messages_) between programs running in parallel. There are several
                high-quality open source MPI implementations (e.g. MPICH, MVAPICH,
                OpenMPI) as well as a variety of closed-source implementations.
                These libraries can typically make use of high-bandwidth low-latency
                communication hardware such as InfiniBand.
                .
                This library @mpi-hs@ provides Haskell bindings for MPI. It is based
                on ideas taken from
                [haskell-mpi](https://github.com/bjpop/haskell-mpi),
                [Boost.MPI](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/doc/html/mpi.html)
                for C++, and [MPI for
                Python](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
                .
                @mpi-hs@ provides two API levels: A low-level API gives rather
                direct access to the actual MPI API, apart from certain "reasonable"
                mappings from C to Haskell (e.g. output arguments that are in C
                stored via a pointer are in Haskell regular return values). A
                high-level API simplifies exchanging arbitrary values that can be
                serialized.
                .
                Note that the automated builds on
                [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org) will currently always fail
                since no system MPI library is present there. However, builds on
                [Stackage](https://www.stackage.org) should succeed -- if not, there
                is an error in this package.
