description:
    Hspec expectations for JSON Values
    .
    Comparing JSON `Value`s in Haskell tests comes with some challenges:
    .
    - In API responses, additive changes are typically safe and an important way
    to evolve responses without breaking clients. Therefore, assertions against
    such responses often want to ignore any unexpected keys in `Object`s (at any
    depth), as any clients would.
    .
    - Order often doesn't matter in API responses either, so it should be possible
    to assert equality regardless of `Array` ordering (again, at any depth).
    .
    - When an assertion fails, showing the difference clearly needs to take the
    above into account (i.e. it can't show keys you've ignored, or ordering
    differences you didn't care about), and it has to display things clearly,
    e.g. as a diff.
    .
    This library handles all these things.
