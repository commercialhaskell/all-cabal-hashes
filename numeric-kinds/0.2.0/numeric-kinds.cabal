synopsis:       Type-level numeric types and classes
description:    This provides numeric types meant for use at the type level with -XDataKinds,
                along with type families that act like type-level typeclasses providing
                various operations.
                .
                Currently, this primarily exists in support of
                <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/snumber snumber> and
                <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dependent-literals-plugin dependent-literals-plugin>,
                and the only type-level numeric type in the current version is @Integer@.
