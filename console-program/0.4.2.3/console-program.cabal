synopsis:        Interpret the command line and a config file as commands and options
description:
  This library provides a framework to build command line programs.
  .
  .
  The constructed program can have several \"commands\" that provide different modes of operation.
  Options can be declared to allow fine-tuning of the behaviour of the program.
  These options are read from the command line when running the program
  and from a simple configuration file.
  .
  .
  Additionally, there is an interactive mode that reads and executes commands from standard input.
  .
  .
  Examples of using this library may be found in the Examples directory in the package tarball.
  .
  .
  It provides functionality similar to the cmdargs package. Main differences:
  .
  - console-program does not use unsafePerformIO, and tries to give a more haskellish, referentially transparent interface;
  .
  - it allows a full tree of commands, instead of a list, so a command can have subcommands;
  .
  - it parses a configuration file, in addition to the command line arguments.
