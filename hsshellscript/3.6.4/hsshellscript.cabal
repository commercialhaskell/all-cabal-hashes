-- The cabal-version field refers to the version of the .cabal specification,
-- and can be different from the cabal-install (the tool) version and the
-- Cabal (the library) version you are using. As such, the Cabal (the library)
-- version used must be equal or greater than the version stated in this field.
-- Starting from the specification version 2.2, the cabal-version field must be
-- the first thing in the cabal file.

-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:           Using Haskell for Unix shell scripting tasks

Description:         A Haskell-library for tasks which are usually done in
                     shell scripts. This includes parsing command line
                     arguments, dealing with paths, some commands for dealing
                     with files, calling external programs and subroutines as
                     separate processes, pipes and redirection of input and
                     output and error handling.
