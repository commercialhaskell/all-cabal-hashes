synopsis:            Efficient simple pretty printing combinators
description:         A pretty printer turns a tree structure into indented text,
                     such that the indentation reflects the tree structure. To keep
                     text short, substructures are put into a single line as far as
                     possible. The library provides combinators for building
                     pretty printers. It emphasizes simplicity and efficiency.
