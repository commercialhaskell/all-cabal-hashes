version:            1.1.0.0

synopsis:           Yet another streaming library.
description:
  This is a streaming library focused on simplicity at the cost of some
  expressivity.

  Basic operations like `drop` and `take` are supported.

  The `Functor`, `Applicative` and `Monad` instances of the stream type
  resemble those of pure lists. There are also `Monoid`, `Alternative` and
  `MonadPlus` instances for stream concatenation.

  Provides resource-managing operations like `withFile` that are easily
  integrated into streams.

  For expressive and composable terminal operations, streams can be consumed
  with folds from the "foldl" library.
