Description:
 hledger-irr is a small command-line utility based on Simon
 Michael's hledger library. Its purpose is to compute the internal rate of
 return, also known as the effective interest rate, of a given investment.
 After specifying what account holds the investment, and what account stores
 the gains (or losses, or fees, or cost), it calculates the hypothetical
 annualy rate of fixed rate investment that would have provided the exact same
 cash flow.
 .
 As an example, consider the following irregular investment recorded in a file
 called @speculation.ledger@. The account “Speculation” holds the investment which
 could be, for example, a stock. Regularly, we make sure that the value of the
 account matches the value of the stock, by moving money from or to the account
 “Rate Gain”. It does not really matter when we adjust the price, as long as it
 is correct at the end of our reporting period.

 We can now calculate the rate of return for the whole time or just for parts
 of it (and be freaked out by the volatility of the investment):
 .
 > $ hledger-irr -f speculation.ledger -t "Rate Gain" -i Speculation -c
 > 2011/01/01: €-100.00
 > 2011/02/01: €-10.00
 > 2011/03/01: €30.00
 > 2011/04/01: €-50.00
 > 2011/05/01: €47.00
 > 2011/06/01: €90.00
 > 2011/01/01 - 2018/07/02: -100.00%
 > $ hledger-irr -f speculation.ledger -t "Rate Gain" -i Speculation -e 2011-03-01
 > 2011/01/01 - 2011/03/01: 26.12%
 > $ hledger-irr -f speculation.ledger -t "Rate Gain" -i Speculation -b 2011-03-01
 > 2011/03/01 - 2018/07/02: -100.00%
 > $ hledger-irr -f speculation.ledger -t "Rate Gain" -i Speculation --monthly
 > 2011/01/01 - 2011/02/01: 12.49%
 > 2011/02/01 - 2011/03/01: 41.55%
 > 2011/03/01 - 2011/04/01: -51.44%
 > 2011/04/01 - 2011/05/01: 32.24%
 > 2011/05/01 - 2011/06/01: 95.92%

 Running the utility with @--help@ gives a brief overview over the
 available options:

 Known bugs and issues:
 .
 * Currenlty, hledger-irr does not cope well with multiple commodities (e.g.
   Euro and Dollar, or shares).
 .
 * Also, interest or fees that do not pass through the account selected by
   @--investment-account@ are not taken into consideration.
