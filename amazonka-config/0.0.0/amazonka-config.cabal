description:
    Amazon Config is a fully managed service that provides you with an
    Amazon resource inventory, configuration history, and configuration
    change notifications to enable security and governance. With Amazon
    Config you can discover existing Amazon resources, export a complete
    inventory of your Amazon resources with all configuration details, and
    determine how a resource was configured at any point in time. These
    capabilities enable compliance auditing, security analysis, resource
    change tracking, and troubleshooting.
