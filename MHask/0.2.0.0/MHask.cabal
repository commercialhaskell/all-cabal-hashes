synopsis:            The category of monads
description:         
  MHask is the category where
  .
  * The objects are Haskell types of kind @(* → *)@ that have an instance of `Prelude.Monad'
  .
  * An arrow from object m to object n is a Haskell function of the form @(forall x. m x → n x)@
  .
  * Arrow composition is merely a specialization of Haskell function composition
  .
  * The identity arrow for the object m is the `Prelude.id' function in Haskell,
  specialized to @(forall x. m x → m x)@
  .
  It is assumed that any instances of the classes provided here also have an instance
  for Monad of the form @instance (Monad m) ⇒ Monad (t m)@, thus guaranteeing that @(t m)@
  (or @(t i j m)@ for the indexed types) is always a Monad. If it were valid Haskell, I'd write:
  .
  > class (forall m. Monad m ⇒ Monad (t m)) ⇒ Functor t
  .
  'MHask.Functor.Functor' should actually be called Endofunctor, because if m is an object in MHask,
  then an instance t of `Functor' can map object m to object (t m), and arrows from 
  m to n get mapped to arrows from (t m) to (t n).
