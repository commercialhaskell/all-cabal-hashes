synopsis:            Priority Search Queue
category:            Data Structures
description:         A /priority search queue/ efficiently supports the
                     opperations of both a search tree and a priority queue. A
                     'Binding' is a product of a key and a priority.  Bindings
                     can be inserted, deleted, modified and queried in
                     logarithmic time, and the binding with the least priority
                     can be retrieved in constant time.  A queue can be built
                     from a list of bindings, sorted by keys, in linear time.
