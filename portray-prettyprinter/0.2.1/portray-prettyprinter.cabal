synopsis:       Portray backend for prettyprinter
description:    This provides a
                <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/prettyprinter prettyprinter> backend for
                <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/portray portray> along with derivable
                'Pretty' instances for types with 'Portray' instances.
                .
                This backend has largely superseded the original
                <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/portray-pretty portray-pretty>.  Because
                @prettyprinter@ gives more flexibility to documents at the cost of requiring
                more behavior to be specified explicitly, some formats are nicer with this
                backend, configurable syntax highlighting is supported, and unicode escaping
                is configurable.  However, as this backend is still newer, there are
                potentially more unnoticed formatting bugs.  Please do file bugs on the
                GitHub issue tracker if you find anything that seems obviously wrong!
                .
                Try using 'pp' as the print function in GHCi:
                @:set -interactive-print=Data.Portray.Prettyprinter.pp@!
