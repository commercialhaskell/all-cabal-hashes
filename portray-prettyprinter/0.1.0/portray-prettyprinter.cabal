version:        0.1.0
x-revision: 2
synopsis:       A portray backend using the prettyprinter package.
description:    This provides a
                <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/prettyprinter prettyprinter> backend for
                <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/portray portray> along with derivable
                'Pretty' instances for types with 'Portray' instances.
                .
                This started out as a copy of
                <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/portray-pretty portray-pretty>, and is
                still very similar.  However, @prettyprinter@ gives more flexibility to
                documents at the cost of requiring more behavior to be specified explicitly.
                As such, some formats can be nicer with the @prettyprinter@ backend, but as
                of the initial release, this backend is less mature and hasn't been used in
                practice, so there are likely more formatting bugs.  Please do file bugs on
                the GitHub issue tracker if you find anything that seems obviously wrong!
