synopsis:       Portray backend for prettyprinter
description:    This provides a
                <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/prettyprinter prettyprinter> backend for
                <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/portray portray> along with derivable
                'Pretty' instances for types with 'Portray' instances.
                .
                This started out as a fork of
                <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/portray-pretty portray-pretty>, and is
                still very similar.  However, @prettyprinter@ gives more flexibility to
                documents at the cost of requiring more behavior to be specified explicitly.
                As such, some formats are nicer with the @prettyprinter@ backend,
                configurable syntax highlighting is supported, and unicode escaping is
                configurable.  However, this backend is less mature and hasn't been used as
                much in practice, so there are likely more formatting bugs than in
                @portray-pretty@.  Please do file bugs on the GitHub issue tracker if you
                find anything that seems obviously wrong!
                .
                Try using 'pp' as the print function in GHCi:
                @:set -interactive-print=Data.Portray.Prettyprinter.pp@!
