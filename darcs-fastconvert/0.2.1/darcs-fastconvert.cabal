-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            Import/export git fast-import streams to/from darcs.

Description:         The darcs-fastconvert tool allows you to both import
                     git repositories into darcs (using git fast-export)
                     and export darcs repositories into git (using git
                     fast-import). You may also achieve some success with 
                     3rd-party fast-import/fast-export tools, like
                     bzr-fastimport although this is not explicitly 
                     supported or tested. Often, converting from X to git 
                     and then to darcs works better than direct X to darcs 
                     conversion using 3rd-party tools.
