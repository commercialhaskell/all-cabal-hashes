description:
    This library generates singleton types, promoted functions, and singleton
    functions using Template Haskell. It is useful for programmers who wish
    to use dependently typed programming techniques. The library was originally
    presented in /Dependently typed programming with singletons/, submitted
    to the Haskell Symposium, 2012.

    As of this release date, Haddock was not able to properly process the code
    and produce documentation. Hence, all of the documentation is in the
    README file distributed with the package. This README is also accessible
    from the project home page.
