synopsis:            An HTTP Client based on Free Monads.

description:         `free-http` is an http-client based on Free Monads.
                     `free-http` exposes a Free Monad to express standard http
                     verbs as well as several backends to interpet programs
                     written in the free monad using various http clients
                     (currently: a pure client, an `http-client`-backed client,
                     and a random client). Please see the ReadMe for usage.
