synopsis: Pretty-printing library
description:
  This package contains a pretty-printing library, a set of API's
  that provides a way to easily print out text in a consistent
  format of your choosing. This is useful for compilers and related
  tools.
  .
  This library produces more compact outputs than both
  Wadler-Leijen or Hughes-PJ algorithms, at the expense of computational ressources.
  The API is the same as Wadler-Leijen's.
