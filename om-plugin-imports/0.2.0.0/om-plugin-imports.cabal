synopsis:            Plugin-based import warnings
description:         This is a plutin that acts similar to
                     `-ddump-minimal-imports`, but the style
                     of imports dumped to the dump directory
                     is better. Where "better" means it will
                     satisfy `-Wmissing-import-lists` (which
                     `-ddump-minimal-imports does not always), and it
                     will omit the explicit import list for imports
                     that are already qualified. The files are dumped
                     to <dump-dir>/<module-name>.full-imports. No files
                     will be dumped unless `-dumpdir` is explicitly
                     passed by the user.
