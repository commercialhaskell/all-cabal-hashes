synopsis:            Data type modifiers for property based testing
description:         Property based testing libraries such as QuickCheck tend to include type modifiers. Most of them 
                     are used to quantify over subsets of a type. For example a property on non-empty lists:
                     .
                     @  prop_tail_length (NonEmpty xs) = length (tail xs) == length xs - 1 @
                     .
                     This library is intended to supply these modifiers to be used by testing libraries, in an effort to make  
                     properties more portable between testing frameworks.
                     .
                     For every modifier there is also an access function that converts to the underlying type, which 
                     enables point-free style properties as such: 
                     .
                     @ 
                       prop_tail_length2 = (> 0) . length . nonEmpty 
                     @
