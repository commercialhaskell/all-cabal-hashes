-- Synopsis and description:
Synopsis: Automatic SMS message generator
Description: GenSmsPdu is a Haskell library designed for the random generation 
             of 3GPP SMS messages. It includes a comprehensive data type that 
             encompasses various 3GPP-defined SMS message formats, including 
             SMS-SUBMIT and SMS-DELIVER. Leveraging QuickCheck, GenSmsPdu is 
             capable of automatically generating a series of random SMS messages 
             in this specified data type.

             GenSmsPdu features an encoder that transforms SMS messages into 
             byte-formatted SMS PDUs (Protocol Data Units), along with a decoder 
             for the reverse process. At present, it is capable of generating only 
             single-page SMS messages.
