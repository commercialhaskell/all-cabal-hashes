description:         Backtracking kills performance, so scanner package doesn't support it.
                     But sometimes you just need it. E.g. you have a mostly non-backtracking
                     parser, but a small bit of its grammar is too complex to transform it
                     to non-backtracking form. In that case you can inject a backtracking
                     attoparsec parser into otherwise non-backtracking scanner.
                     .
