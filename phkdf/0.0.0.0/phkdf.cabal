name:                phkdf
version:             0.0.0.0
synopsis:
    Toolkit for self-documenting password hash and key derivation functions.

description:
    Inspired by PBKDF2, HKDF, and TupleHash. Uses HMAC-SHA256 as a primitive.
    
    This is primarily intended to be a highly reliable reference implementation
    for the underlying PHKDF primitives. It also aspires to be production
    ready-ish. The main limitation is that it implemented without mutation,
    meaning that potentially sensitive secrets persist in memory longer than
    necessary.
