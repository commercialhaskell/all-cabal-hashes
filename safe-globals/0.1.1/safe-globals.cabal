description:
    This library provides a way to declare @IORef@s, @TVar@s, @Chan@s, etc.
    at the top level of a module.
    .
    * Declarations are safe.  User code does not invoke @unsafePerformIO@
      or compiler pragmas.
    .
    * Variables are ordinary module-level bindings.  Their scope can be
      controlled through the usual module import/export mechanism.  Unrelated
      code cannot interfere with private variables by guessing some global
      identifier.
    .
    * References are statically typed, and polymorphic references are statically
      forbidden.
    .
    * The implementation is simple, and closely follows existing common practice.
    .
    This library does not prevent the software design problems caused by global
    state.  Rather, it provides some implementation safety for those
    circumstances where global state really is necessary.
    .
    Fundamentally this library just provides Template Haskell macros for the
    usual @unsafePerformIO@ trick, so it is subject to the same caveats.  In
    particular, linking a module and then loading the same module dynamically
    through the GHC API may produce two copies of the same top-level variable.
    See the documentation of @unsafePerformIO@ for additional compiler-specific
    requirements.
    .
    This library may not work properly on GHC before 7.4, due to a GHC bug:
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/5558>
