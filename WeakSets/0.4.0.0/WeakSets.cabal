-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:
    Simple set types. Useful to create sets of arbitrary types and nested sets.

-- A longer description of the package.
description: This package answers two problems : how to make sets of types which does not implement the Ord typeclass and how to make arbitrarily nested sets as set theory allows. The first problem is resolved thanks to `HomogeneousSet` which is a list where duplicates elements are not allowed and the order of elements is forgotten. The second problem is resolved thanks to `PureSet`, it is a tree structure where the order of the branches does not matter.
