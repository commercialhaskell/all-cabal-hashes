name:               bench-graph
version:            0.1.1
synopsis:           Plot and compare benchmarks
description:
  Plot benchmarks and compare them. An easy to use package to produce pretty
  graphs from the @csv@ file generated by @criterion@ or @gauge@ in a few lines
  of code. It is high level yet pretty flexible in what you can do with it e.g.
  you can compare groups of benchmarks side by side showing full measurements
  or a delta, or plot the performance regression of one version of your package
  against another version.
  .
  See the README for comprehensive documentation.
