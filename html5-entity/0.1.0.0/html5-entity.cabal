description:         A library for looking up and validating HTML5 entities.
                     The <http://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/entities.json following>
                     document is used as an authoritative source of the valid
                     entity names and their corresponding codepoints.

                     You can think of this library as about bindings to the data
                     from that file. For usage see the 'Text.Html5.Entity'
                     module.
