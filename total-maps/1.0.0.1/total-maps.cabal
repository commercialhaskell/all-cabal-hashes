name:                total-maps
version:             1.0.0.1
synopsis:            Dense and sparse total maps.
description:
  Total maps are maps that contain a value for every key. This library provides
  various flavors of total maps.
  .
  Dense maps store values for all keys. Sparse maps store a default value
  and the values which differ from the default. Sparse maps trade the lack
  of Traversable for a very fast Foldable instance (if the data is really sparse).
  .
  Bounded maps require the key type to be enumerable and bounded (have a
  finite number of values) for most of their functionality. Subset maps do not
  require the key to be bounded, instead they are parametized by a finite set of
  valid keys. The key subset is retrieved with help of the excellent
  'reflection' library.
  .
  The Data.Total.Array modules provide total map implementations based on vectors.
  It should usually be faster then Maps, unless you need to adjust single elements.
  .
  Maps in this library provide most of their functions in typeclasses and so
  the modules are designed to be imported unqualified.
