description:
    Most json packages define a data structure that corresponds to json values.
    To serialize other values to a json string, then that value must be
    marshalled into the json data structure.
    .
    This library avoids this marshalling step, and is thus potentially more
    efficient when serializing arbitrary data structures.  Unfortunately
    json-builder cannot yet read or process json data,  and it's not clear
    to me yet how pull a similar kind of trick to avoid unnecessary data
    structures when parsing json data into arbitrary data types.
