Synopsis:       Approximate a song from other pieces of sound
Description:
  This program allows you to decompose a set of audio files into chunks
  and use these chunks for building a new audio file
  that matches another given audio file.
  This is very similar to constructing an image
  from small images that are layed out in a rectangular grid.
  .
  The simplest way to use the program consists of the following two steps:
  .
  Step 1: Add chunks from an audio file to the pool:
  .
  > sound-collage --chunksize=8192 decompose track00.wav pool/%06d
  > sound-collage --chunksize=8192 decompose track01.wav pool/%06d
  .
  Attention:
  The chunk size and the number of (stereo) channels
  must be the same for all added files.
  These parameters are not stored in the pool itself
  and thus consistency cannot be checked.
  .
  Adding the same set of audio files to the chunk pool again
  will fool the automatic chunk size determination in the composition step.
  You should not add an audio file twice anyway,
  since it increases disk usage and computation time
  and has no effect to the result.
  .
  Step 2: Compose an approximation of an audio file
  using chunks from the pool
  .
  > sound-collage auto pool/ music.wav collage.f32
  .
  It performs four steps:
  .
  1. Decompose @music.wav@ into chunks
  .
  2. Find best matching chunk from the pool
     for every chunk in the audio file.
  .
  3. Check where it is better to take an
     originally adjacent chunk from the pool.
  .
  4. Compose matching chunks to a single file.
  .
  You can run these steps manually in order to inspect the results,
  repeat individual steps or omit them (e.g. step 3).
  Here an example for stereo music file:
  .
  > sound-collage --chunksize=8192 decompose music.wav music/%06d
  .
  > sound-collage --chunksize=8192 --channels=2 associate pool/ music/ collage/%06d
  .
  > sound-collage --chunksize=8192 --channels=2 adjacent pool/ music/ collage/
  .
  > sound-collage --chunksize=8192 --channels=2 compose collage/ collage.f32
  .
  For the @adjacent@ step there is the @--cohesion@ option.
  It specifies how much adjacent chunks shall be prefered to the best matching chunk.
  (Please note, that the best matching chunk is not actually the best matching one,
  but only an approximatively best one. See below for details.)
  If cohesion is 1 then an adjacent chunk is only prefered
  if it matches better than the best matching chunk.
  If cohesion is larger then adjacent chunks are more often prefered
  to the best matching one.
  If cohesion is zero, then always the best matching chunk is chosen.
  This is like skipping the @--adjacent@ step completely.
  .
  You can use any input format supported by SoX,
  but output is always raw @Float@ format, i.e. @.f32@.
  Spectra are computed and stored in @Float@
  (single precision floating point)
  and chunks in the pool are stored in @Int16@.
  .
  This is how it works:
  Since there is a lot of data to process
  I have chosen the following optimization
  that however influences the result.
  I group all chunks according to the index of the largest Fourier coefficient.
  All chunks with the same index are stored in one file.
  For the search of matching chunks I traverse the Fourier indices.
  Then e.g. for Fourier index 10 I load all chunks from the pool
  and all chunks from the decomposed music
  and find best matching chunks only within this group.
  This way I may miss the best matching chunk,
  but save a lot of computation (I hope so).
  .
  Btw. if you also add @music.wav@ to the pool,
  then @music.wav@ will not be restored by the collage algorithm
  since the audio files are decomposed into overlapping chunks.
  .
  Approximation is done using simple L2 norm.
  It is well-known that this does not match human perception very good.
  Maybe it is a good idea to work with lossily compressed audio files
  where all non-audible waves are already eliminated.
  In this case the L2 norm might better match
  the human idea of similarity of audio chunks.
