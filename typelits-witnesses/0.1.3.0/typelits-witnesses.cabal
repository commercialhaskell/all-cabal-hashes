synopsis:            Existential witnesses, singletons, and classes for operations on GHC TypeLits
description:         Provides witnesses for 'KnownNat' and 'KnownSymbol'
                     instances for various operations on GHC TypeLits - in
                     particular, the arithmetic operations defined in
                     "GHC.TypeLits", and also for type-level lists of
                     'KnownNat' and 'KnownSymbol' instances.
                     .
                     This is useful for situations where you have
                     @'KnownNat' n@, and you want to prove to GHC
                     @'KnownNat' (n + 3)@, or @'KnownNat' (2*n + 4)@.
                     .
                     It's also useful for when you want to work with type
                     level lists of 'KnownNat' or 'KnownSymbol' instances and
                     singletons for traversing them, and be able to apply
                     analogies of 'natVal' and 'symbolVal' to lists with
                     analogies for 'SomeNat' and 'SomeSymbol'.
                     .
