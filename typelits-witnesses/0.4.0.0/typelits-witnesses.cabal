synopsis:       Existential witnesses, singletons, and classes for operations on GHC TypeLits
description:    This library contains:
                .
                *   A small specialized subset of the *singletons* library as it pertains to
                    `Nat` and `Symbol`, for when you need some simple functionality without
                    wanting to invoke the entire *singletons* library.
                *   Operations for manipulating these singletons and `KnownNat` and
                    `KnownSymbol` instances, such as addition and multiplication of
                    singletons/`KnownNat` instances.
                *   Operations for the comparison of `Nat`s in a way that works well with
                    *GHC.TypeLits*'s different comparison systems.  This is helpful for
                    bridging together libraries that use different systems; this functionality
                    is not yet provided by *singletons*.
