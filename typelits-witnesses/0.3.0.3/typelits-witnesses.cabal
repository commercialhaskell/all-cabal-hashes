synopsis:       Existential witnesses, singletons, and classes for operations on GHC TypeLits
description:    Provides witnesses for 'KnownNat' and 'KnownSymbol'
                instances for various operations on GHC TypeLits - in
                particular, the arithmetic operations defined in
                "GHC.TypeLits", and also for type-level lists of
                'KnownNat' and 'KnownSymbol' instances.
                .
                This is useful for situations where you have
                @'KnownNat' n@, and you want to prove to GHC
                @'KnownNat' (n + 3)@, or @'KnownNat' (2*n + 4)@, or when
                constraints on the lower or upper limits of @n@ are
                needed.
                .
                It's also useful for when you want to work with type
                level lists of 'KnownNat' or 'KnownSymbol' instances and
                singletons for traversing them, and be able to apply
                analogies of 'natVal' and 'symbolVal' to lists with
                analogies for 'SomeNat' and 'SomeSymbol'.
                .
                Note that most of the functionality in this library can
                be reproduced in a more generic way using the great
                <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/singletons singletons>
                library.  The versions here are provided as a "plumbing
                included" alternative that makes some commonly found
                design patterns involving GHC's TypeLits functionality a
                little smoother, especially when working with external
                libraries or GHC TypeLit's Nat comparison API.
                .
