description:
  This library provides a timer wheel data structure for
  .
  * /O(1)/ registering @IO@ actions to fire after a given amount of time
  * /O(1)/ canceling registered actions
  .
  It is similar to @TimerManager@ from "GHC.Event", but can scale much better
  under concurrent access patterns.
  .
  An unreleased version of this library has a @backpack@-based signature for
  selecting from a variety of different data structures used internally.
  However, until @backpack@ has broader support on Hackage, and in Haddocks,
  etc, I decided to just hard-code something decent (a priority search queue).
  This makes the @O(1)@ claims above a bit of a lie, as these rely on using a
  linked list data structure internally.
