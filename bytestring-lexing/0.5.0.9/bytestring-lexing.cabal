Category:       Data
Synopsis:
    Efficiently parse and produce common integral and fractional numbers.
Description:
    The bytestring-lexing package offers extremely efficient `ByteString`
    parsers for some common lexemes: namely integral and fractional
    numbers. In addition, it provides efficient serializers for (some
    of) the formats it parses.
    .
    As of version 0.3.0, bytestring-lexing offers the best-in-show
    parsers for integral values. (According to the Warp web server's
    benchmark of parsing the Content-Length field of HTTP headers.) And
    as of version 0.5.0 it offers (to my knowledge) the best-in-show
    parser for fractional/floating numbers.
    .
    Some benchmarks for this package can be found at:

-- This should work as far back as GHC 7.4.1 (== the lower-bound
-- on base), but we don't verify that by CI therefore we don't list it.

-- You can either:
-- (1) have type:exitcode-stdio-1.0 & main-is:
--     where main-is exports `main::IO()` as usual. Or,
-- (2) have type:detailed-0.9 & test-module:
--     where test-module exports tests::IO[Distribution.TestSuite.Test]
--     and you have Build-Depends: Cabal >= 1.9.2
--
-- Rather than using Cabal's built-in detailed-0.9 framework, we
-- could use the test-framework* family of packages with
-- exitcode-stdio-1.0. cf.,
-- <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Decimal-0.4.2/src/Decimal.cabal> Or
-- the tasty* family of packages with exitcode-stdio-1.0. Notice
-- that test-framework-smallcheck is deprecated in favor of
-- tasty-smallcheck. Both have more dependencies than Cabal, so
-- will be harder to install on legacy systems; but then we wouldn't
-- have to maintain our own code to glue into Cabal's detailed-0.9.
-- Note that the oldest Tasty requires base>=4.5 whereas the oldest
-- test-framework seems to have no lower bound on base.
