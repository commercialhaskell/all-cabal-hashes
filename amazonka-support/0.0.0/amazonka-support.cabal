description:
    AWS Support is a one-on-one, fast-response support channel that is
    staffed with experienced support personnel. The service helps customers
    get the most from the products and features provided by Amazon Web
    Services. There are four levels, or tiers, of AWS Support: Basic,
    Developer, Business, and Enterprise. The Basic tier is free of charge
    and offers support for account and billing questions and service limit
    increases. The other tiers offer an unlimited number of technical
    support cases with pay-by-the-month pricing and no long-term contracts,
    providing developers and businesses flexibility to choose the level of
    support that meets their needs.
