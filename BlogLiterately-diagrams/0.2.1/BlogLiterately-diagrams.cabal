synopsis:            Include images in blog posts with inline diagrams code
description:         A plugin for @BlogLiterately@ (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/BlogLiterately>) which turns inline diagrams
                     code into images.
                     This library also provides an executable,
                     @BlogLiteratelyD@, providing a standard instance
                     of @BlogLiterately@ extended with support for
                     inline diagrams code.  For most users it
                     should suffice to simply use @BlogLiteratelyD@ in
                     place of @BlogLiterately@.
                     .
                     To use it, include code blocks with the @dia@ or
                     @dia-def@ class (using pandoc's special extended
                     Markdown syntax
                     (<http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/pandocs-markdown.html>),
                     or BlogLiterately's extended syntax for tagged
                     code blocks
                     (<http://byorgey.wordpress.com/blogliterately/>)),
                     like so:
                     .
                     >     [dia-def]
                     >     -- This block produces no output but its
                     >     -- declarations will be in scope in all the
                     >     -- rest of the diagram blocks.
                     >
                     >     gSq = square 1 # fc green
                     >
                     > NOTE: Square brackets below should be replaced
                     > by curly braces.  Haddock chokes on curly
                     > braces.
                     >
                     > Here is a green square:
                     > 
                     > ```[.dia width='200']
                     > dia = gSq
                     > ```
                     > 
                     > Green squares like `gSq`[.dia height='16']
                     > and blue circles like `circle 1 # fc blue`[.dia height='16']
                     > are extremely important.
                     .
                     Note that attributes like width and height can
                     also be specified, but be sure to put the numbers
                     in quotes or else they will not parse properly.
                     .
                     Running this through @BlogLiteratelyD@ (after
                     replacing square brackets with curly braces)
                     should result in HTML that looks something like
                     this:
                     .
                     <<http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams/hosted/BLD-post-result.png>>
                     .
                     In addition to simple diagrams, @IO@ actions
                     producing diagrams may also be used.  In that
                     case the @IO@ action will simply be run, and the
                     resulting diagram rendered.  This can be useful,
                     for example, when producing a diagram built from
                     some external data or using randomness.
