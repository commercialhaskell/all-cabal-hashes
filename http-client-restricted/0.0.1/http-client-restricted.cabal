Synopsis: restricting the servers that http-client will use
Description: Addition to the http-client and http-client-tls
 libraries, that restricts the HTTP servers that can be used.
 .
 This is useful when a security policy needs to eg, prevent connections to
 HTTP servers on localhost or a local network, or only allow connections
 to a specific HTTP server.
 .
 It handles restricting redirects as well as the initial HTTP connection,
 and it also guards against DNS poisoning attacks.
