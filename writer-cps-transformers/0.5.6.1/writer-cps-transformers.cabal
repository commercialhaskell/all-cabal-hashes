synopsis:       WriteT and RWST monad transformers
description:    NOTE: From version 0.5.6.0 on the modules provided by this package went upstream to transformers. This package acts as a compatibility package for GHC versions older than 8.6. The WriterT and RWST monad transformers provided by writer-cps-transformers are written in continuation passing style and avoid the space-leak problem of the traditional Control.Monad.Trans.Writer.Strict and Control.Monad.Trans.Writer.Lazy. The corresponding MTL class instances are in the package writer-cps-mtl (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/writer-cps-mtl>).
