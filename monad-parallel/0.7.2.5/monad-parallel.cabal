Version:             0.7.2.5
Cabal-Version:       >= 1.10
Build-Type:          Simple
Synopsis:            Parallel execution of monadic computations
Category:            Control, Monads
Tested-with:         GHC
Description:
  This package defines classes of monads that can perform multiple executions in parallel and combine their results. For
  any monad that's an instance of the class, the package re-implements a subset of the Control.Monad interface, but with
  parallel execution.
