Synopsis:      A reflective JSON serializer/parser.
Stability:     experimental

Build-Type:    Simple

Description:
  See included README for some examples.
  This package uses the Scrap Your Boilerplate With Class approach
  to generics to implement a reflective JSON serializer and deserializer.
  Nested record types are automatically converted to corresponding
  JSON objects and vice versa. In both cases, various aspects of
  serializing and deserializing can be customized by implementing instances of
  type classes. Note that only Haskell 98 types can be
  serialized and deserialized, and that the use of strict constructors will lead
  to runtime errors with the current implemetation. Apart from the
  reflective stuff, the package also provides a straightforward
  Haskell representation of JSON data, together with a unicode-safe
  parser and a suitable implementation of 'show'. The code hasn't yet
  been tested for performance; it might be quite slow.
