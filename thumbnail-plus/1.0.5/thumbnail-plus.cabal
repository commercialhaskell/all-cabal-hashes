description:
  This package provides every tool you need to easily and safely
  generate thumbnails for JPG, GIF and PNG images.
  .
  By safely, we mean that this package should be able to handle
  images uploaded to a public web server without any known
  vulnerabilities:
  .
   * File sizes are constrained and checked.
  .
   * Image sizes are constrained and checked before the images
     are loaded into memory.  Uses @imagesize-conduit@ by Michael
     Snoyman.
  .
   * Optionally, the original image is reencoded before being
     saved.
  .
   * The images are processed using the <http://libgd.bitbucket.org/ GD library>,
     which is heavily battle-tested and
     <http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-2678/Gd-Graphics-Library.html audited by many pairs of eyeballs>.
  .
  Please report any vulnerabilities you may find, we take strive
  to make this library suitable for processing arbitrary images.
