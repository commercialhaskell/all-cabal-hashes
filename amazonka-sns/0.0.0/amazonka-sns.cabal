description:
    Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a fast, flexible,
    fully managed push messaging service. Amazon SNS makes it simple and
    cost-effective to push notifications to Apple, Google, Fire OS, and
    Windows devices, as well as Android devices in China with Baidu Cloud
    Push. You can also use SNS to push notifications to internet connected
    smart devices, as well as other distributed services. Besides pushing
    cloud notifications directly to mobile devices, Amazon SNS can also
    deliver notifications by SMS text message or email, to Amazon Simple
    Queue Service (SQS) queues, or to any HTTP endpoint. To prevent
    messages from being lost, all messages published to Amazon SNS are
    stored redundantly across multiple availability zones.
