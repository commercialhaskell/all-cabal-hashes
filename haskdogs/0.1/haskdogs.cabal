Description:
    haskdogs is a small shellscript-like tool which creates tag file for entire
    haskell project directory. It takes into account first-level dependencies by
    recursively scanning imports and adding matching packages to the final
    tag list.

    As a result, programmer can use his/her text editor supporting tags (vim, for
    example) to jump directly to definition of any standard or foreign function
    he/she uses.

    Note, that haskdogs calls some Unix shell commands like 'test' or 'mkdir'
    so this tool will likely fail to work on pure Windows platforms.
