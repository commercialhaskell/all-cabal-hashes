name:               pcgen
version:            2.0.1
synopsis:           A fast, pseudorandom number generator.
description:
    A fast pseudorandom number generator, as presented by M.E. O'Neill on
    http://www.pcg-random.org, See that site for information on the particulars
    of the technique used. This particular implementation uses two Word64 of
    internal data and produces a Word32 of output per step. On 64-bit machines
    it's two to three times as fast as StdGen and uses the same amount of space.
