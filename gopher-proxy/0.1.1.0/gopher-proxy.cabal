name:                gopher-proxy
version:             0.1.1.0
synopsis:            proxy gopher over http
description:
  @gopher-proxy@ allows to proxy gopher over HTTP, which is mainly useful for HTTP-ifying a specific gopher space.
  .
  A simple invocation looks like this:
  .
  @
  gopher-proxy --host example.org --http-port 8080
  @
  .

  In this particular example @gopher-proxy@ does the following things:
  .
  * Takes HTTP requests on @127.0.0.1:8080@ (to be used by a proxying web server, like nginx), converts those to gopher requests to @example.org@ and returns the gopher responses as HTTP responses
  .
  * Links menu items pointing to external servers to @gopher://@ URLs (this ensures that only one gopher server is proxied) and recognizes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)#URL_links URL links> which are converted to normal HTML links
  .
  * Tries to guess the correct mime-type for every gopher-served file (as it is not included in the response) and wraps text files in a HTML container.
  .
  * And generally works hard to offer the best HTTP equivalent of a given gopher space :)
  .
  To learn about the other parameters for tweaking the behavior of @gopher-proxy@ <#readme see the readme>.
