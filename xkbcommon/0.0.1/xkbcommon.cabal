name:                xkbcommon
version:             0.0.1
synopsis:            Haskell bindings for libxkbcommon
description:
  Wrapper library for libxkbcommon, which is the new alternative for the X11 XKB.h keyboard input
  API. Specifically, it finds keymap files from disk based on Rule\/Model\/Layout\/Variant\/Option
  specifications, and compiles them into a 'Keymap'. From this 'Keymap', a 'KeyboardState' can be
  constructed which represents the states of various physical buttons such as the shift/alt/ctrl
  keys, and can give the correct key symbol based on keyboard events. E.g., pressing the @\<h\>@ key
  while @\<shift\>@ is pressed produces the @H@ symbol in the common QWERTY keymaps, but in e.g.
  the Dvorak keymap, it produces the D symbol.
  .
  After keymap creation, which libxkbcommon can do based on locale preferences and enviroment
  variables, this is all handled by routing keyboard events through libxkbcommon.
  .
  At this stage, these haskell bindings do not make libxkbcommon look much like a haskell library.
  For example, in principle the entire libxkbcommon library is just a stateful processor, and has
  nothing to do with the IO monad.
  However, because I am not yet a very good haskell programmer, and because
  in most realistic use cases input data comes from the IO monad anyway, the stateful operations
  are encoded in the IO monad anyway.
  .
  Note that these bindings load the keysym constants from the libxkbcommon C header files at
  compile time using TH, and similarly keycodes from the Linux header files.
  These should be present for correct compilation.
