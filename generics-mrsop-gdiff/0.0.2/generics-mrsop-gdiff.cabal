name:           generics-mrsop-gdiff
version:        0.0.2
synopsis:       Reimplementation of the gdiff algorithm for generics-mrsop
description:    Here we port the gdiff algorithm and library to work over the generics-mrsop, enabling code that relies on the later library to access the gdiff algorithm. Moreover, we also bring in the utilities for converting a gdiff patch into a more structured version, facilitating merging. For some literature on the topic check Arian's MSc thesis at <https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/380853> or our TyDe 2017 paper at <https://victorcmiraldo.github.io/data/tyde2017.pdf>.
