Description:
  The goals of ShellCheck are:
  .
  * To point out and clarify typical beginner's syntax issues,
    that causes a shell to give cryptic error messages.
  .
  * To point out and clarify typical intermediate level semantic problems,
    that causes a shell to behave strangely and counter-intuitively.
  .
  * To point out subtle caveats, corner cases and pitfalls, that may cause an
    advanced user's otherwise working script to fail under future circumstances.
