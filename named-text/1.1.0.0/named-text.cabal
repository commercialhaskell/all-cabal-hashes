name:               named-text
version:            1.1.0.0
synopsis:           A parameterized named text type and associated functionality.
description:
  .
  A plain String or Text is dangerous because it can be arbitrarily combined,
  converted, emitted, and updated without consideration of the validity and
  applicability of the contents and the usage scenario.
  .
  This module provides a Named type wrapper around Text which has two
  additional type parameters: one which indicates what the content of the Text
  represents, and one which indicates the style of the name.
  .
  There are additionally functions and classes which allow conversions and
  transformations between names with different styles and types (or disallow them
  where appropriate).
  .
  The core intent of this library is that the Named is used instead of a raw
  String or Text to provide type-level tracking and safety.
