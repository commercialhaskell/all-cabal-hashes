-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
synopsis:            Provides zips with default values.

-- A longer description of the package.
description:         Typical zip functions like `zip`, `zipWith`, and `zipWith3` will stop with the shortest list exhausted. Consequently information is lost. This library solves this issue by inserting default values. The `these` package serves a similar purpose but allows more than just lists to be zipped with the `Align` type class. However, zipping several lists and using defaults is not as easy.
