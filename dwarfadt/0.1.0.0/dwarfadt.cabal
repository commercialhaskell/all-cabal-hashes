synopsis:            High-level wrapper around the dwarf library
description:         dwarf is an excellent library to read dwarf files, but the output of
                     parsing dwarf is very low-level and difficult to work with.
                     .
                     This library intends to wrap dwarf and return a simple ADT representing
                     the DWARF information in a high-level way, easy to work with.
