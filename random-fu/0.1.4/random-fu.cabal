synopsis:               Random number generation
description:            Random number generation based on modeling random 
                        variables in two complementary ways: first, by the
                        parameters of standard mathematical distributions and,
                        second, by an abstract type ('RVar') which can be
                        composed and manipulated monadically and sampled in
                        either monadic or \"pure\" styles.
                        
                        The primary purpose of this library is to support 
                        defining and sampling a wide variety of high quality
                        random variables.  Quality is prioritized over speed,
                        but performance is an important goal too.
                        
                        In my testing, I have found it capable of speed 
                        comparable to other Haskell libraries, but still
                        a fair bit slower than straight C implementations of 
                        the same algorithms.
                        
                        Warning to anyone upgrading from \"< 0.1\": 'Discrete'
                        has been renamed 'Categorical', the entropy source 
                        classes have been redesigned, and many things are no
                        longer exported from the root module "Data.Random"
                        (In particular, DevRandom - this is not available on 
                        windows, so it will likely move to its own package 
                        eventually so that client code dependencies on it will 
                        be made explicit).
                        
                        Support for "base" packages earlier than version 4
                        (and thus GHC releases earlier than 6.10) has been 
                        dropped, as too many of this package's dependencies do
                        not support older versions.
                        
                        The "Data.Random" module itself should now have a
                        relatively stable interface, but the other modules
                        are still subject to change.  Specifically, I am 
                        considering hiding data constructors for most or all 
                        of the distributions.

Tested-with:            GHC == 6.10.4, GHC == 6.12.1, GHC == 6.12.3,
                        GHC == 7.0.1, GHC == 7.0.2
