synopsis: Combinators to build command line parsers

description: multiarg is a parser combinator library to build command
 line parsers. With it you can easily create parsers with options
 that take more than one option argument--for example, I created
 multiarg due to the apparent lack of such ability amongst other
 parsers. Its basic design is loosely inspired by Parsec.
 .
 Provides ParserT, a monad you use to build parsers. ParserT is a monad
 transformer, so you can layer it on top of other monads. For instance
 you could layer it on the IO monad so that your parser can perform IO.
 .
 It also has a simple, pre-built parser built with the underlying
 combinators, which works for many situtations and shields you from the
 underlying complexity if you don't need it.
 .
 See the documentation in the System.Console.MultiArg module for
 details.
