Cabal-Version: 2.2
Name:         storable-tuple
Version:      0.1
Category:     Data, Foreign
Synopsis:     Storable instance for pairs and triples
Description:
  Provides a Storable instance for pair and triple
  which should be binary compatible with C99 and C++.

  The only purpose of this package is to provide a standard location
  for this instance so that other packages needing this instance
  can play nicely together.

  Note however, that the original purpose of the @Storable@ class
  was the transfer of primitive types between Haskell and foreign code.
  This purpose was already extended by HSC,
  which creates @Storable@ instances for records from C header files.
  Nonetheless,
  @Storable@ instances for tuples were omitted from @base@ by intention.
  Instead of using the orphan instances from this package,
  you may instead use the custom class or the wrapper type
  from the module @Foreign.Storable.Record.Tuple@
  from the package @storable-record@.
