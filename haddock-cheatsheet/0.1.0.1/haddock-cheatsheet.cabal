synopsis: A documentation-only package exemplifying haddock markup features
description:
  This package provides a documentation module giving examples of all haddock markup features.
  Compared with the official <https://haskell-haddock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/markup.html haddock documentation>
  ,this package is more compact, while also being descriptive enough to use from scratch.
  Both the source and rendered document are meant to be used together.
