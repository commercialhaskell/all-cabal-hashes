synopsis:            Extensible records and variants indexed by a type-level Red-Black tree.

description:         A library that provides extensible records and variants,
                     both indexed by a type-level red-black tree that maps
                     Symbol keys to value types of any kind. 
                     .
                     The keys correspond to fields
                     names in records, and to branch names in variants.
                     . 
                     At the term level, value types come wrapped in a type
                     constructor of kind @q -> Type@, where @q@ is the kind of
                     value types.
                     .
                     The records and variants can be converted to and from
                     regular Haskell datatypes; also to and from the unlabelled
                     n-ary products and sums of the @sop-core@ package.
