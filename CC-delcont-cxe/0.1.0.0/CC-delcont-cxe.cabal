Synopsis:           A monad transformers for multi-prompt delimited control

                    This library implements the superset of the interface described in
                    *   /A Monadic Framework for Delimited Continuations/,
                       R. Kent Dybvig, Simon Peyton Jones, and Amr Sabry

                    .
                    This library's "Control.Monad.CC.CCcxe" is derived as a CPS version of
                    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/CC-delcont-exc>'s Control.Monad.CC.CCExc.
                    "Control.Monad.CC.CCcxe" is sometimes more efficient; it is always less perspicuous.
                    Both libraries provide the identical interface and are interchangeable. It seems
                    that CC-delcont-exc's  Control.Monad.CC.CCExc is faster at delimited control but
                    imposes more overhead on the conventional code; "Control.Monad.CC.CCcxe" is dual.
                    It pays to use "Control.Monad.CC.CCcxe" in code with long stretches of determinism
                    punctuated by fits and restarts.

                    This package split multi-prompt delimited control from
                    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/liboleg> for usability.
