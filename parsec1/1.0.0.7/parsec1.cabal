synopsis:       Portable monadic parser combinators
description:
    Parsec is designed from scratch as an industrial-strength parser
    library.  It is simple, safe, well-known, has extensive libraries,
    good error messages, and is also fast.
    .
    This package is the core haskell98 part of the parsec2
    package as originally created by Daan Leijen. It is intended to
    preserve its simplicity and portability.
    .
    This version differs from the pervious one only by a MonadFail
    instance to let it compile with ghc-8.8.
