description:
    Parsec is designed from scratch as an industrial-strength parser
    library.  It is simple, safe, well documented (on the package
    homepage), has extensive libraries and good error messages,
    and is also fast.
    .
    This package is the core haskell98 part of the parsec2
    package, intended to preserve its simplicity and portability.
    .

    Note, that the module names overlap with those of parsec from the Haskell
    Platform, therefore I do not recommend to unconditionally use parsec1 (or
    parsec2 and parsec3) as dependency in cabal files of packages for hackage.
    But you may want to develop your code using these limited and portable
    parsec1 functions and finally change the dependency from parsec1 to parsec
    in order to avoid module ambiguities for users just installing your package.
    Your own module ambiguities are best avoided by hiding packages.
    .

    This version only differs from the pervious one by improved error messages
    for try (positions are not reset), tokens and thus string (longer
    unexpected strings are now reported to match the error position).
    The notFollowedBy-parser was generalized (as in parsec-3) so
    characters in messages are now shown in single instead of double
    quotes.
    Also (as since parsec-3.1.2) lookAhead no longer consumes tokens on success
    (so that the many-parser can detect this).
