    Parsec is designed from scratch as an industrial-strength parser
    library.  It is simple, safe, well-known, has extensive libraries,
    good error messages, and is also fast.

    This package is the core haskell98 part of the parsec2
    package as originally created by Daan Leijen. It is intended to
    preserve its simplicity and portability.
