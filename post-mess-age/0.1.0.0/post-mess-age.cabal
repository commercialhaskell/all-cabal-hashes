synopsis:            Send messages to a Handle concurrently without getting them mixed.
description:         Do you have a program that output messages to the screen from different
                     threads and you are tired of getting them all messed up? Welcome to the
                     /post-mess-age/. Using a simple /passer object/ you can make your logging
                     messages useful again. The methodology is explained in the API docs.
                     You can use post-mess-age not only for the 'stdout' handle, but with any
                     handle!
