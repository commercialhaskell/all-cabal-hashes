synopsis: Instances from the serialise library for the safe-money library.
description:
  This library exports @Serialise@ instances (from the @serialise@
  library) for many of the types exported by the @safe-money@ library.
  .
  Note: The code in this library used to be part of the @safe-money@
  library itself, so these instances are intended to be backwards
  compatible with older versions of @safe-money@.
