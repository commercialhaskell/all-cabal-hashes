    Amazon GameLift Service

    Welcome to the /Amazon GameLift API Reference/. Amazon GameLift is a managed Amazon Web Services (AWS) service for developers who need a scalable, server-based solution for multiplayer games. Amazon GameLift provides setup and deployment of game servers, and handles infrastructure scaling and session management.

    This reference describes the low-level service API for GameLift. You can call this API directly or use the <https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk AWS SDK> for your preferred language. The AWS SDK includes a set of high-level GameLift actions multiplayer game sessions. Alternatively, you can use the <https://aws.amazon.com/cli/ AWS command-line interface> (CLI) tool, which includes commands for GameLift. For administrative actions, you can also use the Amazon GameLift console.

    __Manage Games and Players Through GameLift__

    Call these actions from your game clients and\/or services to create and manage multiplayer game sessions and player sessions.

    -   __Game sessions__
        -   < CreateGameSession>
        -   < DescribeGameSessions>
        -   < DescribeGameSessionDetails>
        -   < UpdateGameSession>
        -   < SearchGameSessions>
    -   __Player sessions__
        -   < CreatePlayerSession>
        -   < CreatePlayerSessions>
        -   < DescribePlayerSessions>
    -   __Other actions:__
        -   < GetGameSessionLogUrl>

    __Set Up and Manage Game Servers__

    Use these administrative actions to configure GameLift to host your game servers. When setting up GameLift, you\'ll need to (1) configure a build for your game and upload build files, and (2) set up one or more fleets to host game sessions. Once you\'ve created and activated a fleet, you can assign aliases to it, scale capacity, track performance and utilization, etc.

    -   __Manage your builds:__
        -   < ListBuilds>
        -   < CreateBuild>
        -   < DescribeBuild>
        -   < UpdateBuild>
        -   < DeleteBuild>
        -   < RequestUploadCredentials>
    -   __Manage your fleets:__
        -   < ListFleets>
        -   < CreateFleet>
        -   Describe fleets:
            -   < DescribeFleetAttributes>
            -   < DescribeFleetCapacity>
            -   < DescribeFleetPortSettings>
            -   < DescribeFleetUtilization>
            -   < DescribeEC2InstanceLimits>
            -   < DescribeFleetEvents>
            -   < DescribeRuntimeConfiguration>
        -   Update fleets:
            -   < UpdateFleetAttributes>
            -   < UpdateFleetCapacity>
            -   < UpdateFleetPortSettings>
            -   < UpdateRuntimeConfiguration>
        -   < DeleteFleet>
    -   __Manage fleet aliases:__
        -   < ListAliases>
        -   < CreateAlias>
        -   < DescribeAlias>
        -   < UpdateAlias>
        -   < DeleteAlias>
        -   < ResolveAlias>
    -   __Manage autoscaling:__
        -   < PutScalingPolicy>
        -   < DescribeScalingPolicies>
        -   < DeleteScalingPolicy>

    .
    The types from this library are intended to be used with
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/amazonka amazonka>, which provides
    mechanisms for specifying AuthN/AuthZ information and sending requests.
    .
    Use of lenses is required for constructing and manipulating types.
    This is due to the amount of nesting of AWS types and transparency regarding
    de/serialisation into more palatable Haskell values.
    The provided lenses should be compatible with any of the major lens libraries
    such as <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens lens> or
    <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core lens-family-core>.
