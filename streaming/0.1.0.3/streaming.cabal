synopsis:            A general free monad transformer 
                     optimized for streaming applications.
                     
description:         `Stream` can be used wherever `FreeT` is used. The compiler
                     is better able to optimize operations written in
                     terms of `Stream`.
                     .
                     An associated prelude of functions, closely following 
                     @Pipes.Prelude@ is focused on on employment with a base 
                     functor like @((,) a)@ (here called @Of a@) which generates
                     effectful sequences or producers - @Pipes.Producer@, 
                     @Conduit.Source@, @IOStreams.InputStream@, @IOStreams.Generator@
                     and the like.
                     .
                     Interoperation with `pipes` is accomplished with this isomorphism:
                     .  
                     > Pipes.unfoldr Streaming.next :: Stream (Of a) m r -> Producer a m r
                     > Stream.unfoldr Pipes.next    :: Producer a m r -> Stream (Of a) m r
                     .
                     Exit to `conduit` and `iostreams` is thus:
                     .
                     > Conduit.unfoldM Streaming.uncons   :: Stream (Of a) m ()  -> Source m a
                     > IOStreams.unfoldM Streaming.uncons :: Stream (Of a) IO () -> InputStream a
