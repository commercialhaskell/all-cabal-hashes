Synopsis:           An algebraic data type similar to Prelude Ordering.
Description:        Typically this is used as the return type of a combining comparison, which combines two
                    values if they are deemed equal in some sense. Currently combining comparisons are used
                    extensively by the AVL tree package (AvlTree).
