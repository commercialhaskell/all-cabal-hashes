synopsis:            Manipulating Common Intermediate Language AST
description:         Language-Cil is a Haskell library for manipulating CIL
                     abstract syntax and generating .il files.
                     .
                     Common Intermediate Language (CIL), formerly known as
                     Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL), is the lowest
                     level language that runs on Microsoft .NET and Mono.
                     .
                     This library is still  under development, it only supports
                     a small subset of the full CIL.
                     .
                     See <https://github.com/tomlokhorst/language-cil#readme>
                     for an example of how to quickly get started.
