synopsis:            Create worker threads that logs exceptions and restarts.
description:
  The package provides means for common pattern in web development in Haskell.
  When you need a thread that makes some task in a loop with sleeping between
  iterations you don't wan't it to die from some occasional exception.
  .
  So, the package contains:
  .
    * Helper to create non-dying labeled threads with logging of occured exceptions.
      Only synchronous exceptions are considered as safe for restoring from. Delay is
      added between respawns of worker.
  .
    * Isolation helpers for subactions that should not interfere with each other.
