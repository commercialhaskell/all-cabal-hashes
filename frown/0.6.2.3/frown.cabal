Synopsis:		LALR(k) parser generator
Description:		Frown is an LALR(k) parser generator for Haskell 98 written in Haskell 98.
			Its salient features are:
			• The generated parsers are time and space efficient. On the downside, the parsers are quite large.
			• Frown generates four different types of parsers. as a common characteristic, the parsers are
			  genuinely functional (ie ‘table-free’); the states of the underlying LR automaton are encoded as
			  mutually recursive functions. Three output formats use a typed stack representation, and one format due
			  to Ross Paterson (code=stackless) works even without a stack.
			• Encoding states as functions means that each state can be treated individually as opposed to a
			  table-driven approach, which necessitates a uniform treatment of states. For instance, look-ahead is
			  only used when necessary to resolve conflicts.
			• Frown comes with debugging and tracing facilities; the standard output format due to Doaitse
			  Swierstra (code=standard) may be useful for teaching LR parsing.
			• Common grammatical patterns such as repetition of symbols can be captured using rule schemata. There
			  are several predefined rule schemata.
			• Terminal symbols are arbitrary variable-free Haskell patterns or guards. Both terminal and
			  nonterminal symbols may have an arbitrary number of synthesized attributes.
			• Frown comes with extensive documentation; several example grammars are included. Furthermore, Frown
			  supports the use of monadic lexers, monadic semantic actions, precedences, and associativity, the
			  generation of backtracking parsers, multiple start symbols, error reporting, and a weak form of error
			  correction.
