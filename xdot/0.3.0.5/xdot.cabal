synopsis:           Parse Graphviz xdot files and interactively view them using GTK and Cairo

                    .
                    Currently not all xdot features are supported. Nodes and
                    edges can be highlighted by hovering them and clicked.
                    .
                    For an example of using this library try the accompanying
                    @Demo.hs@ with the dot-files in @dot-examples/@.
                    .
                    This library was originally written as part of ghc-vis, but
                    is now a separate project, in case anyone else may have a
                    use for it.
