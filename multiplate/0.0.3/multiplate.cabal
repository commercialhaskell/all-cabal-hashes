Synopsis:           Lightweight generic library for mutually recursive data types.
Category:           Generics, Lenses
Description:
    Multiplate is an alternative extension of the Uniplate/Compos core library
    to support mutally recursive
    datatypes in a way that is as powerful as Compos, as easy to use as Biplate, and
    more portable than both of them.

    Multiplate does not require GADTs and does not require multi-parameter type classes.
    It only requires rank 3 polymorphism.
