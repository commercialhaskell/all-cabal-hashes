description:

    This library defines a trivial type used for streaming
    of tabular data using coinductive control structures
    such as pipes, conduit or iteratees with a guaranteed
    constant memory usage.

    In this structure, each /cell/ of data is annotated
    with information about its relation to the following
    cell in the stream, namely /end of cell/, /end of row/
    and /end of table/ conditions. In addition, in order
    to achieve truly-constant memory usage irrespective of
    individual cell size, we allow individual cells to be
    subdivided further into /parts/, as indicated by the
    /end of part/ condition. Logically, this subdivision
    into parts is supposed to be purely operational and
    have no semantic significance, similarly to subdivision
    of lazy bytestrings into chunks.
