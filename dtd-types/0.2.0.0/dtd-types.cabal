version: 0.2.0.0
synopsis: Basic types for representing XML DTDs
description:
  This package provides types to represent an XML Document Type
  Declaration (DTD) as defined in W3C specifications
  (<http://www.w3.org/XML/Core/#Publications>). It is intended to be
  compatible with and extend the set of types in "Data.XML.Types"
  provided by the xml-types package.
  .
  Following the philosophy of @Data.XML.Types@, the types in this
  module are not intended to be a strict and complete representation
  of the model in the W3C specifications; rather, they are intended
  to be convenient and type-safe for the kinds of processing of DTDs
  that are commonly done in practice. As such, this model is
  compatible with both Version 1.0 and Version 1.1 of the XML
  specification.
  .
  Therefore, these types are not suitable for type-level validation
  of the syntax of a DTD. For example: these types are more
  lenient than the specs about the characters that are allowed in
  various locations in a DTD; entities of various kinds only appear
  as distinct syntactic elements in places where they are commonly
  needed when processing DTDs; etc.
  .
  Conditional sections are not represented in these types. They
  should be handled directly by parsers and renderers, if needed.
