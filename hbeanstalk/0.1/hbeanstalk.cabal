Synopsis:       Client for the beanstalkd workqueue service.
Description:    This is the hbeanstalk library.  It provides a client
                interface to a beanstalkd server, allowing Haskell to be
                a producer and/or a consumer of work items.  Let Haskell
                do your heavy lifting!
