synopsis:            Simple OAuth client code built atop http-conduit

description:         
  /Warning/: This software is pre 1.0 and thus its API may change very
  dynamically while updating only minor versions. This package will follow the
  PVP once it reaches version 1.0.
  .
  OAuth is a popular protocol allowing servers to offer resources owned by some
  user to a series of authorized clients securely. For instance, OAuth lets
  Twitter provide access to a user's private tweets to the Twitter client
  registered on their phone.
  . 
  @oauthenticated@ is a Haskell library implementing OAuth protocols atop the
  minimalistic @http-client@ HTTP client library extracted from @http-conduit@.
  It offers a simplified main API in "Network.OAuth" which provides simplistic,
  authenticated @GET@ and @POST@ requests atop OAuth using a trivial state
  monad. It also offers a lower-level API in "Network.OAuth.Signing" which can
  be used to sign arbitrary requests while intercepting and modifying the OAuth
  parameter set.  
  .
  There's also an implementation of OAuth's three-legged credential acquisition
  protocol built atop the "Network.OAuth" API. This can be handled in both
  conformant and old-style modes: conformant will reject server responses which
  are not conformant with RFC 5849 (which builds atop community version OAuth
  1.0a) while old-style better allows for less-than-compliant servers. See
  'Network.OAuth.Types.Params.Version' for more details.
  .
  Currently @oauthenticated@ only supports OAuth 1.0 and is in alpha. OAuth 2.0
  support is a potential goal, but it's unclear if it can be transparently
  supported at a similar level of abstraction.
