-- A short (one-line) description of the package.
Synopsis:            Concurrent Chans as read/write pairs. Also provides generic
                     Chan, Cofunctor classes.

-- A longer description of the package.
Description:         A wrapper around Control.Concurrent.Chan that splits a Chan
                     into a pair, one of which allows only read operations, the
                     other write operations. 
                     .
                     This makes code easier to reason about, allows us to define
                     useful instances ('Functor' and 'Cofunctor') on the chan
                     pairs.
                     .
                     In addition this package provides a module that defines a
                     pair of classes 'ReadableChan' and 'WritableChan' which
                     defines the basic methods any Chan type should provide.
                     .
                     To use standard Chans with these polymorphic functions,
                     import as follows:
                     .
                     > import Control.Concurrent.Chan hiding (readChan,writeChan,writeList2Chan)
                     > import Control.Concurrent.Chan.Class
                     .
                     When used alongside standard Chans, the Split module can be
                     imported qualified like:
                     .
                     > import qualified Control.Concurrent.Chan.Split as S
                     .
                     Note, we do not implement the deprecated unGetChan and 
                     isEmptyChan functions.
                     .
                     This module is used internally by the simple-actors package.
