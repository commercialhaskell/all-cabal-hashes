Description:         A parser based on derivatives of parser combinators (Might
                     and Darais).  Our paper on Arxiv details the theory of
                     parsing with derivatives: <http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.5023>.
                     This implementation uses my latest work on the theory that
                     brings the O(n*|G|^2) complexity bound to O(n) for parsing
                     most not-painfully-ambiguous grammars.  (|G| would be the
                     size of the initial grammar, n would be size of the input.
                     These bounds are based off of observation and intuition;
                     they are not proven yet.)  This implementation will not
                     terminate if the resulting parse frest is infinite.  We
                     know how to extend the implementation to work for infinite
                     parse trees with little effort.  If this is something you
                     would like to see, shoot me an email.
