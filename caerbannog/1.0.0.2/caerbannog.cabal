synopsis: That rabbit's got a vicious streak a mile wide!
description:
  Warning: This package is not maintained anymore.
  .
  Caerbannog is a drop in replacement for the @binary-bits@ package. Unlike
  @binary-bits@ Caerbannog works with GHC 8.10, 8.8, and 8.6.
  .
  The original package description of @binary-bits@ at version 0.5 was: "Bit
  parsing\/writing on top of binary. Provides functions to read and write bits
  to and from 8\/16\/32\/64 words."
  .
  Caerbannog allows you to do bit level gets and puts on top of the interface
  provided by the @binary@ package. This can be useful for parsing or
  generating binary formats that are not byte aligned.
  .
  There are many names for these types of actions: get and put, read and write,
  parse and generate, deserialize and serialize, decode and encode. Caerbannog
  doesn't care which word you use. It'll work anyway.
