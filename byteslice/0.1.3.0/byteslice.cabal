synopsis: Slicing managed and unmanaged memory
description:
  This library provides types that allow the user to talk about a slice of
  a ByteArray or a MutableByteArray. It also offers UnmanagedBytes, which
  is kind of like a slice into unmanaged memory. However, it is just an
  address and a length.
