synopsis:            Types for working with Linux packet sockets
description:
    @network-packet-linux@ makes it possible to use
    the [network package](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/network)
    with Linux packet sockets. Packet sockets are described
    in [packet (7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/packet.7.html).
    .
    === Usage
    Combine functions from [Network.Socket.Address](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/network/docs/Network-Socket-Address.html#g:2) with types from "Network.Socket.Linux" in order to
    work with packet sockets.
    .
    See the "Network.Socket.Linux" module documentation or @examples/ListenToInterface.hs@ for an example.
    .
    === About the package
    As of version 3.0.0, the @network@ package provides a socket API that is
    implemented in terms of the 'SocketAddress' typeclass.
    @network-packet-linux@ provides 'SockAddrLl', a 'SocketAddress' instance
    that corresponds to the @sockaddr_ll@ struct from @\<linux/if_packet.h\>@.
    .
    Additionally, @network-packet-linux@ provides some convenience types:
    'ProtocolId' (an enumeration of the Ethernet protocol IDs defined in
    @\<linux/if_ether.h\>@) and 'PacketType' (enumerating the packet types
    defined in @\<linux/if_packet.h\>@).
    .
    __Hackage note__: The false dependency on `vendored-network` is an annoying
    side effect of the way we pull in `network` files. Ideally the dependency
    on `network` files should be an internal cabal library, but internal
    libraries aren't supported for the build style we need.
