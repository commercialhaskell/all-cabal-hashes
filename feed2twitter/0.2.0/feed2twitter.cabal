synopsis:            Send posts from a feed to Twitter
description:         Reads feeds and tweets each post to a Twitter account.
                     This is both a library and a simple executable build on top
                     of it.
                     .
                     The feed is read only once. To keep updating, call this 
                     program/library every few minutes.
                     A local cache of earlier tweets is kept in a file to make
                     sure no duplicates are sent.
                     .
                     To build your own program on top of this library use the
                     `atom2twitter` or `rss2twitter` functions. If you need
                     access to the complete feed instead of just individual
                     individual items, use the `feed2twitter` function.
                     .
                     See the `hackage2twitter` program for an example of how to
                     use this library.
                     .
                     The executable can be used as such:
                     .
