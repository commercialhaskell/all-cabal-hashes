synopsis:            Rose trees with cached and accumulating monoidal annotations
description:         Rose (n-ary) trees with both upwards- (/i.e./
                     cached) and downwards-traveling (/i.e./
                     accumulating) monoidal annotations.  This is used
                     as the core data structure underlying
                     the @diagrams@ framework
                     (<https://diagrams.github.io>), but
                     potentially has other applications as well.
                     .
                     Abstractly, a DUALTree is a rose (n-ary) tree
                     with data (of type @l@) at leaves, data (of type
                     @a@) at internal nodes, and two types of monoidal
                     annotations, one (of type @u@) travelling \"up\"
                     the tree and one (of type @d@) traveling
                     \"down\".
                     .
                     See "Data.Tree.DUAL" for full documentation.
                     "Data.Tree.DUAL" provides a public API which
                     should suffice for most purposes.
                     "Data.Tree.DUAL.Internal" exports more of the
                     internal implementation---use it at your own
                     risk.
