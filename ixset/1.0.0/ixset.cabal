Synopsis:            Efficient relational queries on Haskell sets. 
Description:         
    Just pick which parts of your data structures you want indexed
    using an easy to use template-haskell function. Spare yourself the
    need to write, run, and maintain code that marshalls your data
    to/from an external relational database just for efficient
    queries. happstack-ixset relies on generics and TH to spare you
    the boilerplate normally required for such tasks.
