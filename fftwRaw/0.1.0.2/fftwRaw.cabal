version:             0.1.0.2
synopsis:            Low level bindings to FFTW.
description:         
    Yet another set of Haskell bindings to <http://www.fftw.org/ FFTW>, the Fastest Fourier Transform in the West.
    .
    These are low level bindings with some type safety for a small subset of FFTW's functionality. Raise an Issue on Github if you need something I haven't implemented.
    .
    Unlike the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fft fft> package, this package provides low level manipulation of FFTW plans (such as `fftw_plan_dft_1d`).
    .
    Unlike the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-fftw vector-fftw> package, this package is based on pointers instead of the Vector datatype and it avoids copying the input arrays by assuming that the pointers are aligned as FFTW expects.
