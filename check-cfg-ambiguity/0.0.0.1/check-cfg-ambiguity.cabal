 .
 It is impossible to check arbitrary context free grammar for ambiguity on a Turing machine. So we provide you brute force algorithm up to a limit.
 .
 You can also use function "upTo" from package "Earley-0.13.0.1" for the same purpose, but it can freeze on infinitely ambiguous grammars: https://github.com/ollef/Earley/issues/54 . So I decided to write and publish this package.
 .
