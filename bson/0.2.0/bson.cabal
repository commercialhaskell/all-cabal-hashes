Name:          bson
Version:       0.2.0
Synopsis:      BSON documents are JSON-like objects with a standard binary
               encoding.
Description:   A BSON Document is an untyped (dynamically type-checked) record.
               I.e. it is a list of name-value pairs, where a Value is a single
               sum type with constructors for basic types (Bool, Int, Float,
               String, and Time), compound types (List, and (embedded) Document),
               and special types (Binary, Javascript, ObjectId, RegEx, and a few
               others).

	           A BSON Document is serialized to a standard binary encoding
               defined at <http://bsonspec.org>. This implements version 1 of
               that spec.
