Name:             type-equality
Version:          0.1.0.1
Synopsis:         Type equality, coercion/cast and other operations.
Description:      In the presence of GADTs, sometimes a proof is
                  needed that two types are equal. This package
                  contains an equality type for this purpose, plus its
                  properties (reflexive, symmetric, transitive) and
                  some useful operations (substitution, congruence,
                  coercion/cast). It also contains a type class for
                  producing equality proofs, providing some form of
                  decidable equality on types.
