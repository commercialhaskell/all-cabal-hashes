Name:                privileged-concurrency
Version:             0.6.2
Synopsis:            Provides privilege separated versions of the concurrency primitives.

Description:
    Any @MVar@ or other concurrency primitive can be read by or written to any
    function which recieves it as a value. This package provides read-only and
    write-only versions of @Chan@, @MVar@, @TChan@, @TMVar@, and @TVar@.
    Functions which use these versions receive permission to read, write, or
    both based on their type signatures.
