Description:         Using records, especially nested records, in
                     Haskell can sometimes be a bit of a chore.
                     Fortunately, there are several libraries in hackage
                     that make working with records easier. This library
                     is my attempt to build on top of these libraries to
                     make working with records even more pleasant!
                     .
                     In most imperative languages, records are accessed
                     using the infix dot operator. Record fields can be
                     read simply by suffixing a record value with
                     '.field' and they can be modified by simply
                     assigning to that location. Although this is not
                     the only way to access records (indeed, Haskell
                     does not use it), many people (including myself)
                     like it. This library attempts to support this
                     style for Haskell records in the following manner:
                     .
                     > record.field.subfield      becomes     record .# field # subfield
                     > record.field = value       becomes     record .# field =: value
                     .
                     Of course, the infix assignment in Haskell is pure
                     and doesn't actually mutate anything. Rather, a
                     modified version of the record is returned.
                     .
                     In addition, the following features are supported:
                     .
                      * Accessing several fields simultaneously using
                        tuples.
                        Example: @record .# (field1, field2, field3)@
                     .
                      * Accessing records inside a @'Functor'@.
                        Example: @recordInFunctor \<.#\> field@
                     .
                      * Composing fields with @'Applicative'@ functors
                        and @'Monad'@s.
                        Example: @record .\# applicativeField \<\#\> subfield@
                     .
                      * Pattern matching using @ViewPatterns@.
                        Example: @case record of (match field -> 1) -> ...@
                     .
                      * Easy comparisons etc. using @'onField'@.
                        Example: @sortBy (compare \`onField\`
                        field#subfield) records@
                     .
                     For a detailed description of usage, see
                     "Data.Record.Field".
                     .
                     This library is a work-in-progress. Some
                     limitations, deficiencies, points of interest and
                     possible future improvements include:
                     .
                      * Currently, a @'Field'@ instance is only provided
                        for @"fclabels"@ lenses, since that is what I
                        have personally used.  However, there should be
                        nothing in principle that would prevent adding
                        instances for @"data-accessor"@ and @"lenses"@.
                        However, doing this would make this package
                        depend on several record libraries at once,
                        which might not be the best approach. Perhaps
                        this package should be split into several
                        packages?
                     .
                      * Similarly, the @'field'@ method currently
                        returns an @"fclabels"@ lens. To fully decouple
                        this package from @"fclabels"@, the @'field'@
                        method probably has to be split into @getField@,
                        @setField@ and @modField@ or something similar.
                     .
                      * For monad transformers, @"transformers"@ and
                        @"monads-fd"@ are used, since those are what
                        @"fclabels"@ uses. This might be a problem for a
                        program that uses @"mtl"@ instead.
                     .
                      * To avoid lots of parentheses, @"fields"@ uses
                        high-precedence operators at three operator
                        precedence levels. The goal was to make field
                        accesses directly usable in arithmetic
                        expressions (e.g.  @r1\.\#int + r2\.\#int@).
                        Unfortunately, since Haskell has a finite number
                        of precedence levels, this goal was not properly
                        met, since @('*')@ and all higher-precedence
                        arithmetic operators have conflicting precedence
                        levels.
                     .
                      * Performance has not been analyzed at all. To my
                        knowledge, GHC doesn't do type class
                        specialization or method inlining by default, so
                        needlessly generic code might be generated, even
                        if all types are statically known. I'm hoping
                        that this can be addressed using @SPECIALIZE@
                        and @INLINE@ pragmas if it turns out to be an
                        issue.
