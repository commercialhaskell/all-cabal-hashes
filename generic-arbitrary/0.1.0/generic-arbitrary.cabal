synopsis:            Generic implementation for QuickCheck's Arbitrary
description:
    Generic implementations of methods of the 'Arbitrary' class from the
    QuickCheck library. The approach taken here can lead to diverging instances
    for recursive types but is safe for non-recursive ones and guarantees
    flat distribution for constructors of sum-types.
