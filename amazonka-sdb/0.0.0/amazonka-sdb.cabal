description:
    Amazon SimpleDB is a highly available and flexible non-relational data
    store that offloads the work of database administration. Developers
    simply store and query data items via web services requests and Amazon
    SimpleDB does the rest. Unbound by the strict requirements of a
    relational database, Amazon SimpleDB is optimized to provide high
    availability and flexibility, with little or no administrative burden.
    Behind the scenes, Amazon SimpleDB creates and manages multiple
    geographically distributed replicas of your data automatically to
    enable high availability and data durability. The service charges you
    only for the resources actually consumed in storing your data and
    serving your requests. You can change your data model on the fly, and
    data is automatically indexed for you. With Amazon SimpleDB, you can
    focus on application development without worrying about infrastructure
    provisioning, high availability, software maintenance, schema and index
    management, or performance tuning.
