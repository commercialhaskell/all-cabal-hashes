description:
        This is a wrapper around <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Crypto>
        that currently does fingerprint generation, signature generation, and
        signature verification (for RSA keys only).
        .
        It is indended to be used with <http://hackage.haskell.org/openpgp>
        .
        It is intended that you use qualified imports with this library.
        .
        > import qualified Data.OpenPGP.Crypto as OpenPGP
