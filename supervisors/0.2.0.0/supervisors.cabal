synopsis:            Monitor groups of threads with non-hierarchical lifetimes.
description:
  The @supervisors@ package provides a useful abstraction for managing the
  groups of Haskell threads, which may not have a strictly hierarchical
  structure to their lifetimes.
  .
  Concretely, the library provides a `Supervisor` construct, which can be
  used to safely spawn threads while guaranteeing that:
  .
  * When the supervisor is killed, all of the threads it supervises will be
    killed.
  * Child threads can terminate in any order, and memory usage will always
    be proportional to the number of *live* supervised threads.
  .
  One way to think of it is that @supervisors@ is to @async@ as
  @resourcet@ is to @bracket@.
  .
  Note that this package is EXPERIMENTAL; it needs more careful testing before
  I can earnestly recommend relying on it.
  .
