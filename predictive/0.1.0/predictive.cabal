description:  This is a library for predictive scans.  Its aim is to
    improve user experience in cases when user interactions have to be
    acknowledged by a remote host.  It closes the gap between requesting
    the interaction and the remote end acknowledging it by predicting
    what the remote end will decide based on local information.  If the
    prediction is wrong, it automatically backtracks to the last state
    known to be consistent.
    .
    Simple example:  Your application displays a client-side text box,
    but each edit made to it has to be acknowledged by a server.
    However, most of the time the server will acknowledge, so your
    application can use this library to proceed under this assumption
    and only backtrack, if the server disagrees.
