Name:          Win32-junction-point
Version:       0.2.1.1
Synopsis:      Support for manipulating NTFS junction points.
Description:
  This package provides the ability to manipulate NTFS junction points as
  supported by Windows 2000 and above. Junction points, along with NTFS hard
  links and NTFS symbolic links, are a type of symbolic link that can be made
  between folders existing on the same filesystem. Please read Microsoft
  KB205524 [1] for more information on junction points.
  .
  Junction points have always been left undocumented in the Win32 SDK. The
  Windows 2000 Resource Kit came with a command-line utility named linkd.exe
  to work with them. Later, Mark Russinovich of SysInternals distributed a
  replacement utility named Junction [2] which accomplished the same thing.
  .
  This source code is based on an article [3] and C++ library [4] written by
  Mike Nordell at codeproject.com.
  .
  It is against Microsoft's recommendation to make use of undocumented API
  features. Use this library at your own risk.
