description:
    Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS cloud resources and
    the applications you run on AWS. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to
    collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, and set
    alarms. Amazon CloudWatch can monitor AWS resources such as Amazon EC2
    instances, Amazon DynamoDB tables, and Amazon RDS DB instances, as well
    as custom metrics generated by your applications and services, and any
    log files your applications generate. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to
    gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application
    performance, and operational health. You can use these insights to
    react and keep your application running smoothly.
