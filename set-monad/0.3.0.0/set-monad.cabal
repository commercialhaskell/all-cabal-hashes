version:            0.3.0.0
synopsis:           Set monad
description:
  The @set-monad@ library exports the @Set@ abstract data type and
  set-manipulating functions. These functions behave exactly as their namesakes
  from the @Data.Set@ module of the @containers@ library. In addition, the
  @set-monad@ library extends @Data.Set@ by providing @Functor@, @Applicative@,
  @Alternative@, @Foldable@, @Monad@, and @MonadPlus@ instances for sets.
  .
  In other words, you can use the @set-monad@ library as a drop-in replacement
  for the @Data.Set@ module of the @containers@ library and, in addition, you
  will also get the aforementioned instances which are not available in the
  @containers@ package.
  .
  It is not possible to directly implement instances for the aforementioned
  standard Haskell type classes for the @Set@ data type from the @containers@
  library. This is because the key operations @map@ and @union@, are constrained
  with @Ord@ as follows.
  .
  > map :: (Ord a, Ord b) => (a -> b) -> Set a -> Set b
  > union :: (Ord a) => Set a -> Set a -> Set a
  .
  The @set-monad@ library provides the type class instances by wrapping the
  constrained @Set@ type into a data type that has unconstrained constructors
  corresponding to monadic combinators. The data type constructors that
  represent monadic combinators are evaluated with a constrained run function.
  This elevates the need to use the constraints in the instance definitions
  (this is what prevents a direct definition). The wrapping and unwrapping
  happens internally in the library and does not affect its interface.
  .
  For details, see the rather compact definitions of the @run@ function and
  type class instances. The left identity and associativity monad laws play a
  crucial role in the definition of the @run@ function. The rest of the code
  should be self explanatory.
  .
  The technique is not new. This library was inspired by [1]. To my knowledge,
  the original, systematic presentation of the idea to represent monadic
  combinators as data is given in [2]. There is also a Haskell library that
  provides a generic infrastructure for the aforementioned wrapping and
  unwrapping [3].
  .
  The @set-monad@ library is particularly useful for writing set-oriented code
  using the do and/or monad comprehension notations. For example, the
  following definitions now type check.
  .
  > s1 :: Set (Int,Int)
  > s1 = do a <- fromList [1 .. 4]
  >         b <- fromList [1 .. 4]
  >         return (a,b)
  .
  > -- with -XMonadComprehensions
  > s2 :: Set (Int,Int)
  > s2 = [ (a,b) | (a,b) <- s1, even a, even b ]
  .
  > s3 :: Set Int
  > s3 = fmap (+1) (fromList [1 .. 4])
  .
  As noted in [1], the implementation technique can be used for monadic
  libraries and EDSLs with restricted types (compiled EDSLs often restrict the
  types that they can handle). Haskell's standard monad type class can be used
  for restricted monad instances. There is no need to resort to GHC extensions
  that rebind the standard monadic combinators with the library or EDSL specific
  ones.
