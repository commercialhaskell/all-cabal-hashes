synopsis:            Non-GC'd, contiguous storage for immutable data structures
description:
    This package provides user-facing APIs for working with
    "compact regions", which hold a fully evaluated Haskell object graph.
    These regions maintain the invariant that no pointers live inside the struct
    that point outside it, which ensures efficient garbage collection without
    ever reading the structure contents (effectively, it works as a manually
    managed "oldest generation" which is never freed until the whole is
    released).

    This package is currently highly experimental, but we hope it may
    be useful to some people.  It is GHC 8.2 only.  The bare-bones library
    that ships with GHC is ghc-compact.
