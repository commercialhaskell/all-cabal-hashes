synopsis:            Reversible parsing and pretty-printing.
description:
  .
  "syntax" allows you to write a single syntax description and instantiate is both as a parser and a pretty printer.
  .
  Syntax descriptions are written in applicative or arrow style. The library uses a custom typeclass hierarchy, provided
  by the "semi-iso" package. Most of the time you will be using operators like '/$/', '/*/' and '/+/' (= '<|>'), just
  like parser combinators. When more power is needed - e.g. when the syntax depends on the parsed or printed value -
  you turn to arrows.
  .
  Semi-isomorphisms from "semi-iso" are the basic building block of syntax descriptions. I recommend reading
  the hackage page of "semi-iso" first, as it contains much more information.
  .
  Once you write a syntax description (polymorphic in the syntax category) you can instantiate it both as a parser or as
  a pretty-printer. The library "syntax-attoparsec" gives you the ability to extract an Attoparsec parser. Pretty-printing
  is implemented by the "syntax-printer" library, which uses Text and ByteString builders. (Note that formatting is handled
  by "syntax" itself, not by the printer library)
  .
  Advanced formatting and parsing (for example indentation, haskell layout rule) is implemented as category transformers
  (similar to monad transformers). Currently only simple indentation is implemented (in "Data.Syntax.Indent") - basically
  a reader category transformer that tracks current indentation level. I plan on implementing Haskell layout rule in the
  future.
  .
  The library can work with both text and binary data. Alas, there are no binary combinators implemented yet.
  .
  EXAMPLES! See @syntax-example@ and @syntax-example-json@ for examples.
  .
  * "syntax-example" implements a simple lambda calculus.
  .
  * "syntax-example-json" implements a json parser and pretty printer.
