name:                syntax
version:             0.3.0.0
synopsis:            Syntax descriptions for unified parsing and pretty-printing.
description:
  'syntax' allows you to write a single syntax description and instantiate is both as a parser and a pretty printer.
  .
  The interface is based on a custom Functor\/Applicative\/Monad hierarchy, provided by the 'semi-iso' package. You fmap using
  a semi-isomorphism instead of function. A semi-isomorphism is a isomorphism that can fail in both directions, with slightly
  weakened laws. It is worth to note that @Iso@s and @Prism@s from 'lens' are valid semi-isomorphisms :)
  .
  Once you write a description you can, for example turn it into an Attoparsec parser, or into a 'Data.Syntax.Printer.Text.Printer'.
  .
  See @syntax-example@ and @syntax-example-json@ for examples, @syntax-attoparsec@ and @syntax-printer@ for a parser/printer implementation.
  .
  The library was inspired by:

  * Rendel, Tillmann, and Klaus Ostermann. "Invertible syntax descriptions: unifying parsing and pretty printing." ACM Sigplan Notices. Vol. 45. No. 11. ACM, 2010.
  .
  TODO:
  .
  * Research relative monads and relative monad transformers. Indent is basically a Reader monad over a syntax. How would a State monad look?
  .
  * Try to implement Haskell layout rule.
  .
  * Combinators for binary data formats, vectors.
  .
  * Better error messages.
  .
  * Maybe an implementation of do notation for SemiIsoMonad with QuasiQuoters, like the codo notation for comonads.
