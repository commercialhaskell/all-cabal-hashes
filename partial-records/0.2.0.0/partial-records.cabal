synopsis:            Template haskell utilities for constructing records with default values
description:         .
  If you have a datatype with a lot of default-able fields, e.g.
  .
  > data Foo =
  >   { fld1 :: Maybe Int
  >   , fld2 :: Maybe Char
  >   , fld3 :: Word
  >   }
  .
  and you want to avoid the the boilerplate of writing all the default values
  every time you construct a record of this type, you could write a "default
  value" of this type:
  .
  > defaultFoo :: Foo
  > defaultFoo = Foo { fld1 = Nothing, fld2 = Nothing, fld3 = 0 }
  .
  You could then use record modification syntax to make necessary changes to
  this value. But perhaps you can't / don't want to provide default values for
  /all/ of the fields, but only some of them? You could implement a "default
  smart constructor" that would take the non-optional arguments and then fill in
  the optional ones like so:
  .
  > defaultFoo :: Word -> Foo
  > defaultFoo x = Foo { fld1 = Nothing, fld2 = Nothing, fld3 = x }
  .
  But then you lose the benefit of record syntax: you can't name the fields
  you're providing values for.
  .
  This package reconciles the two problems: with only a little bit of Template
  Haskell it provides a way to construct a record with optional fields while
  also letting you refer to the names of those fields. You make two splices:
  .
  > mkToPartial ''Foo
  >   -- defines 'mkfld1', 'mkfld2', 'mkfld3'
  > mkFromPartial "mkFoo" [t|Foo|] [|Foo { fld1 = Nothing, fld2 = Nothing }
  >   |]
  >   -- defines 'mkFoo'
  .
  And then you can use them like so:
  .
  > val :: Foo
  > val = mkFoo
  >   $ mkfld3 123
  >   ? mkfld1 (Just 456)
  > -- val = Foo { fld1 = Just 456, fld2 = Nothing, fld3 = 123 }
  .
  The Template Haskell splice lets you define default values for a subset of the
  fields, and those defaults will be used when you call @mkFoo@. You can list
  fields in any order, but if you omit a mandatory field (one that doesn't have
  a default), that would be a type error at compile time.
  .
  You can make multiple 'Data.Partial.TH.mkFromPartial' splices, this is
  occasionally useful for parameterized types, for example:
  .
  > data Bar a =
  >   { bar1 :: Maybe Int
  >   , bar2 :: a
  >   }
  > mkToPartial ''Bar
  > mkFromPartial "mkBar" [t|forall a. Bar a|]
  >   [|Bar { bar1 = Nothing }
  >   |]
  >   -- mkBar :: ... -> Bar a, and bar2 is a required field
  > mkFromPartial "mkBarMaybe" [t|forall a. Bar (Maybe a)|]
  >   [|Bar { bar1 = Nothing, bar2 = Nothing }
  >   |]
  >   -- mkBarMaybe :: ... -> Bar (Maybe a), and bar2 is an optional field
