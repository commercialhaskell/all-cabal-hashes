version:             0.1.0.1
synopsis:            Give wai Applications an IO-based inner monad
description:         This package allows IO-based monads in covariant and contravariant positions
                     of wai Applications.
                     .
                     The monads, which are applicable for this, need to have MonadBaseControl IO
                     instances.
                     This are for most cases ReaderT stacks based on the IO monad.
                     This package will especially be of interest, if you are sharing access to
                     MVars, TVars or other concurrent data, while controlling that access with
                     monad transformers.
                     .
                     This package is based on
                     <https://github.com/athanclark/wai-transformers wai-transformers> by Athan
                     Clark.
