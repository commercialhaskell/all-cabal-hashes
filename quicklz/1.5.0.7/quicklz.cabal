name:                quicklz
version:             1.5.0.7
synopsis:            binding to QuickLZ compression library
description:         
  This package provides a high level binding to the QuickLZ (<http://quicklz.com>) library
  for ByteStrings, under the GPLv2 license. QuickLZ is fast and compresses very well.
  .
  This package includes the QuickLZ 1.5.0 source code, with compression level 1 and streaming
  currently disabled.
  .
  The versioning scheme for this package is unusual. QuickLZ tries to be as fast as possible,
  and will break backwards compatibility to achieve it in newer versions. This versioning scheme
  reflects the QuickLZ versioning scheme: the first three digits of version w.x.y.z are
  the quicklz version, with the 'z' component (and any further needed ones) being updates to this package,
  not quicklz.
