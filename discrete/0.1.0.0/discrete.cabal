description:
  A 'Discrete' type is a set X with at least one element, along with two                                                                    
  functions, @'succ' :: X -> 'Maybe' X@ and @'pred' :: X -> 'Maybe' X@,                                                                     
  such that all inhabitants of the set X can be constructed given at least                                                                  
  a single element of the set and these two functions. The following must hold:                                                             

  @'pred' '>=>' 'succ' '>=>' 'pred' = 'pred'@                                                                                               

  @'succ' '>=>' 'pred' '>=>' 'succ' = 'succ'@                                                                                               

  This means that 'Int' is a discrete type, because given any x :: 'Int', one                                                               
  can construct any other 'Int' with the following functions:                                                                               

  @'succ' x = if x '==' 'maxBound' then 'Nothing' else 'Just' (x '+' 1)@                                                                                                                                             
  @'pred' x = if x '==' 'minBound' then 'Nothing' else 'Just' (x '-' 1)@                                                                  

  This also means that something like 'Double' is /not/ a discrete type, because                                                            
  there are no such functions 'succ' and 'pred' that given any value of type 'Double'                                                       
  can allow the construction of all values of type 'Double'.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                            
  'Discrete' acts as a replacement for 'GHC.Enum.Enum'. The motivation for                                                                  
  'Discrete' is two-fold: firstly, totality of all typeclass instances, and                                                                 
  secondly, that 'GHC.Enum.Enum' is a typeclass that does too many things,                                                                  
  and does them poorly. If 'succ' or 'pred' are called on 'maxBound'                                                                        
  or 'minBound', respectively, the result will be 'Nothing'.
