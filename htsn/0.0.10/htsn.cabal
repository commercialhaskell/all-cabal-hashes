synopsis:
  Parse XML files from The Sports Network feed.
description:
  /Usage/:
  .
  @
  htsn [OPTIONS] [HOSTNAMES]
  @
  .
  The Sports Network <http://www.sportsnetwork.com/> offers an XML feed
  containing various sports news and statistics. The goal of /htsn/
  is to watch the XML feed and parse the individual XML documents into
  files.
  .
  Once started, we will choose an XML feed host to connect to. The
  choice is made from a list in a round-robin fashion, and by default,
  the list contains all known TSN feed hosts. Once we have a connection,
  your username and password are sent. If they are accepted, we begin to
  parse the feed saving all XML files to the configured output directory
  (see @--output-directory@).
  .
  If we encounter an error (say, the connection is dropped), then we
  will attempt to connect to the next host in the list after waiting
  five seconds. This process continues indefinitely.
  .
  The program can run either interactively (that is, outputting to the
  console), or as a daemon with the @--daemonize@ flag.
  .
  /Input/:
  .
  The program takes no input; a username and password must be supplied
  on the command-line or in a configuration file.
  .
  /Output/:
  .
  Output is not generated when running as a daemon; otherwise, standard
  out and standard error are fairly noisy. All traffic between /htsn/ and
  the feed server is displayed on stdout. Status messages are
  interspersed when they are generated with warnings and errors going to
  stderr. The following can be expected:
  .
    * The only data we send to the feed are the username and password.
      These will be highlighted in green on stdout.
  .
    * All data received from the feed will be echoed in the default color
      to stdout.
  .
    * Informational messages will be highlighted in cyan and sent to stdout.
  .
    * Warnings will be highlighted in yellow and sent to stderr.
  .
    * Errors will be highlighted in red and sent to stderr.
  .
  /Logging/:
  .
  Logging is done either to syslog or a file. The destination and
  verbosity are controlled by the @--log-file@, @--log-level@,
  and @--syslog@ parameters which may be specified either on the command
  line or in the configuration file.
  .
  /Options/:
  .
  @
  \--daemonize, -d
  @
  .
  Run as a daemon, in the background. When running as a daemon the
  \--pidfile, --run-as-group, and --run-as-user flags become relevant.
  .
  Default: disabled
  .
  @
  \--log-file
  @
  .
  If you specify a file here, logs will be written to it (possibly in
  addition to syslog). Can be either a relative or absolute path. It
  will not be auto-rotated; use something like logrotate for that.
  .
  Default: none
  .
  @
  \--log-level
  @
  .
  How verbose should the logs be? We log notifications at four levels:
  DEBUG, INFO, WARN, and ERROR. Specify the \"most boring\" level of
  notifications you would like to receive (in all-caps); more
  interesting notifications will be logged as well. The debug output is
  extremely verbose and will not be written to syslog even if you try.
  .
  Default: INFO
  .
  @
  \--output-directory, -o
  @
  .
  To which directory should we write the XML files?
  .
  Default: .
  .
  @
  \--password
  @
  .
  The password associated with your TSN username. A password is
  required, so you must supply one either on the command line or in a
  configuration file.
  .
  Default: none
  .
  @
  \--pidfile
  @
  .
  (Daemon mode only) Create a PID file in the given location. This is
  used by the init system on Unix to keep track of the running daemon.
  .
  If necessary, its parent directory will be created with owner/group
  set to the appropriate user/group, but at most one directory will
  be created (that is, we won't create an entire directory tree).
  .
  Default: \/run\/htsn\/htsn.pid
  .
  @
  \--run-as-group
  @
  .
  (Daemon mode only) Run as the given system group. The PID file is
  written before privileges are dropped, so the only privileges needed
  by /htsn/ are those necessary to write the XML files and (optionally)
  the log file.
  .
  Default: the current group
  .
  @
  \--run-as-user
  @
  .
  (Daemon mode only) Run as the given system user. The PID file is
  written before privileges are dropped, so the only privileges needed
  by /htsn/ are those necessary to write the XML files and (optionally)
  the log file.
  .
  Default: the current user
  .
  @
  \--syslog, -s
  @
  .
  Enable logging to syslog. On Windows this will attempt to communicate
  (over UDP) with a syslog daemon on localhost, which will most likely
  not work.
  .
  Default: disabled
  .
  @
  \--username, -u
  @
  .
  Your TSN username. A username is required, so you must supply one
  either on the command line or in a configuration file.
  .
  Default: none
  .
  /Feed Hosts/:
  .
  It is possible to pass a list of feed hostnames on the command-line
  (see [HOSTNAMES] in the synopsis). By default /htsn/ will attempt
  to connect to every known TSN XML feed host in a round-robin fashion,
  so there is rarely a need to do this.
  .
  /Configuration File/:
  .
  Any of the command-line options mentioned above can be specified in a
  configuration file instead. We first look for \"htsnrc\" in the
  system configuration directory. We then look for a file named
  \".htsnrc\" in the user's home directory. The latter will override
  the former.
  .
  The user's home directory is simply $HOME on Unix; on Windows it's
  wherever %APPDATA% points. The system configuration directory
  is determined by Cabal; the /sysconfdir/ parameter during
  the \"configure\" step is used.
  .
  The file's syntax is given by examples in the htsnrc.example file
  (included with /htsn/).
  .
  Options specified on the command-line override those in either
  configuration file.
