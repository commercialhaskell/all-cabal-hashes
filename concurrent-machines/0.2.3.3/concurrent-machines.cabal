synopsis:            Concurrent networked stream transducers

description: A simple use-case for this library is to run the stages
             of a pipelined streaming computation concurrently. If
             data is streaming through multiple processing stages, you
             might build a machine like
             .
             @
             step1 >~> step2 >~> step3
             @
             .
             The @>~>@ operator connects the machines on
             either side with a one-element buffer. This means that
             data is pulled from upstream sources eagerly (perhaps
             pulling one more value than will be consumed by
             downstream), but it also means that each stage can be
             working simultaneously, increasing throughput of the
             entire pipeline.
             .
             A few small examples are available in the @examples@
             directory of the source repository.
