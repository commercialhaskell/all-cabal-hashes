Build-type:          Simple
Cabal-version:       >= 1.8
Description:
  This package provides a function to create a dendrogram from a
  list of items and a distance function between them.  Initially
  a singleton cluster is created for each item, and then new,
  bigger clusters are created by merging the two clusters with
  least distance between them.  The distance between two clusters
  is calculated according to the linkage type.  The dendrogram
  represents not only the clusters but also the order on which
  they were created.
  .
  This package has many implementations with different
  performance characteristics.  There are SLINK and CLINK
  algorithm implementations that are optimal in both space and
  time.  There are also naive implementations using a distance
  matrix.  Using the @dendrogram@ function from
  @Data.Clustering.Hierarchical@ automatically chooses the best
  implementation we have.
  .
  Changes in version 0.4:
  .
  * Specialize the distance type to Double for efficiency reasons.
    It's uncommon to use distances other than Double.
  .
  * Implement SLINK and CLINK.  These are optimal algorithms in
    both space and time for single and complete linkage,
    respectively, running in /O(n^2)/ time and /O(n)/ space.
  .
  * Reorganized internal implementation.
  .
  * Some performance improvements for the naive implementation.
  .
  * Better test coverage.  Also, performance improvements for the
    test suite, now running in 3 seconds (instead of one minute).
  .
  Changes in version 0.3.1.2 (version 0.3.1.1 was skipped):
  .
  * Added tests for many things.  Use @cabal test@ =).
  .
  Changes in version 0.3.1:
  .
  * Works with containers 0.4 (thanks, Doug Beardsley).
  .
  * Removed some internal unnecessary overheads and added some strictness.
  .
  Changes in version 0.3.0.1:
  .
  * Listed changes of unreleased version 0.2.
  .
  Changes in version 0.3:
  .
  * Added function @cutAt@.
  .
  * Fixed complexity in Haddock comments.
  .
  Changes in version 0.2:
  .
  * Added function @elements@.
  .
  * Added separate functions for each linkage type.  This may be
    useful if you want to create a dendrogram and your distance
    data type isn't an instance of @Floating@.
