-- A longer description of the package.
description: Near zero-cost coercions between unlifted boxed and lifted types.
             There are 3 main ingredients to this library:
             (1) a newtype @Strict :: LiftedType -> UnliftedType@,
             (2) a newtype @Lazy :: UnliftedType -> LiftedType@, and
             (3) a coercion function @levCoerce@ to coerce existing functions
                 into accepting @Strict@ wrapper.
