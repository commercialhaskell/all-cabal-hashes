description:
    /Repeatable builds for cabalized Haskell projects/
    .
    \'cabal-constraints\' provides repeatable builds for cabalized Haskell
    projects by \"freezing\" the exact versions of the dependencies selected by
    \'cabal-install\'. All build environments for the project, such as the test
    or staging build environments, or other developers collaborating on the
    project, will then use the same dependency versions.
    .
    It is designed to be used alongside \'cabal-install\' sandboxes, in which
    case isolated, repeatable builds can be achieved.
    .
    /Using cabal-constraints/
    .
    \'cabal-constraints\' should be run from the root directory of a cabalized
    Haskell project and given the path to the `setup-config` file to use. It will
    print out all dependencies of the project in a format suitable for use in a
    `cabal-install` config file. For example, running \'cabal-constraints\'
    against itself produces the following:
    .
    @
    $ cabal-constraints dist\/dist-sandbox-500003c6\/setup-config
    constraints: Cabal == 1.19.0
               , array == 0.4.0.1
               , base == 4.6.0.1
               , bytestring == 0.10.0.2
               , containers == 0.5.0.0
               , deepseq == 1.3.0.1
               , directory == 1.2.0.1
               , filepath == 1.3.0.1
               , ghc-prim == 0.3.0.0
               , integer-gmp == 0.5.0.0
               , old-locale == 1.0.0.5
               , pretty == 1.1.1.0
               , process == 1.1.0.2
               , rts == 1.0
               , time == 1.4.0.1
               , unix == 2.6.0.1
    @
    .
    A single mandatory argument must be provided which is the path to the
    @setup-config@ file to use. The file will be located under the @dist@
    directory. Usually there will be a single @setup-config@ file which can be
    found by running @find dist -name setup-config@ from the root directory of the
    project.  If your project has more than one such file, it is likely because
    you have built it either with and without sandboxes or with multiple
    sandboxes.  You probably want the most recently modified file which can be
    found with @ls -tr $( find dist -name setup-config ) | tail -n1@.
    .
    To use these constraints for reproducible builds, one should make use of the
    new sandbox feature of @cabal-install@ 1.18. The constraints can be redirected
    to @cabal.config@ and committed to your code repository.  When the project is
    built, the same set of dependency versions will be resolved by @cabal-install@
    ensuring repeatable builds.
    .
    If @cabal.config@ contains no other information the simplest solution is to
    overwrite it:
    .
    @
    $ cabal-constraints > cabal.config
    @
    .
    If @cabal.config@ contains information that needs to be preserved, the
    following will replace the @constraints@ section and everything following it
    with the new constraints. If you ensure that the @constraints@ section is the
    last section of the file, all other information in it will be kept.
    .
    @
    $ sed -i \/^constraints:\/,$d cabal.config && cabal-constraints >> cabal.config
    @
