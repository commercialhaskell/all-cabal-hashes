synopsis: Stack-based concatenative language embedded in Haskell

description:
  Jaskell is a stack-based programming language implemented using normal Haskell 
  types and functions, along with a quasiquoter that allows for a more elegant syntax
  than what pure Haskell supports. Since it is embedded in Haskell, Jaskell is purely 
  functional and, unlike other stack-based languages, statically typed. The standard 
  library is based on that of [Joy](https://www.kevinalbrecht.com/code/joy-mirror/), 
  and the name \"Jaskell\" is a portmanteau of \"Joy\" and \"Haskell.\"
  .
  A Jaskell program is a sequence of commands. Each command is a function which takes 
  a stack &#8212; represented in Haskell as a left-nested tuple &#8212; and returns another stack. 
  In order to accomodate side effects, commands need not actually be functions; any 
  arrow is allowed as a command. The two most useful arrow types are @(->)@ and @Kleisli IO@.
  .
  Two example programs are shown below. The first program asks for the user's name and then
  prints a greeting. The second program defines a @qsort@ function and then uses it to
  sort a list.
