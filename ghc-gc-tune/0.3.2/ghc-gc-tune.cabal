name:           ghc-gc-tune
version:        0.3.2
synopsis:       Graph performance of Haskell programs with different GC flags
description:    ghc-gc-tune runs your compiled Haskell program with
                different GC flags, and generates a graph of time as
                those GC settings vary. ghc-gc-tune lets your automate
                the task of finding good GC flags for your program, in
                order to get the best performance from it.
                .
                Graphs are rendered with gnuplot, so make sure that is
                installed.
                .
                Example use:
                .
                > cabal install ghc-gc-tune
                > ghc-gc-tune -t svg binarytrees 12
                .
                Example output:
                .
