synopsis:       Conversions between common string types, as well as Base16/Base32/Base64.
description:
    Have you ever found yourself frustrated that you're spending 15-30% of your
    time in Haskell converting between string types, remembering which module has
    the `toStrict` function, importing Data.Text.Encoding and
    Data.Text.Lazy.Encoding qualified, spending time thinking about how to do
    Base64 encoding, etc.? Or tried to use one of the (excellent) typeclass-based
    string conversion libraries, only to find yourself adding awkward type
    signatures to avoid type-inferencing ambiguities?
    .
    This package exports a collection of functions that follow a simple pattern:
    .
    @stringTypeAToStringTypeB :: a -> b@
    .
    This way, if you import @Data.String.FromTo@ unqualified, or as part of
    your Prelude, all you have to think about is which type you want to convert
    into which other type.
    .
    For convenience, this package also exposes conversions between Base16, Base32,
    and Base64-encoded strings.
