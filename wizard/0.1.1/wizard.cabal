name:                wizard
version:             0.1.1
synopsis:            the fantastical wizard monoid
description:
  A "wizard" can be defined as a program that
  prompts a user "up front" for multiple inputs
  and then performs several actions after all
  input has been collected.
 
  The idea is from Gabriel Gonzalez's blog post,
  http://www.haskellforall.com/2018/02/the-wizard-monoid.html.

  This library provides a "WizardT" monad
  transformer, that allows users to define
  wizards over different monads, which becomes
  similarly useful when that monad's `Monoid`
  instance lifts the behaviour of the underlying
  `Monoid` into its own.
