flag ghc-bundled-libffi
  description:      When GHC is configured without @--with-system-libffi@, it
                    will bundle its own copies of @libffi@, one of them
                    statically linked and the other dynamically linked. This
                    flag will force linking against the static copy of @libffi@
                    that GHC bundles. This avoids a GHC bug
                    (https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/15397) that
                    can arise when the linker confuses the system's dynamic
                    @libffi@ with GHC's own dynamic @libffi@.

                    Note that this flag only works when GHC is configured
                    without the @--with-system-libffi@ option. This is the case
                    for most GHC binary distributions, such as those provided
                    by @ghcup@. If you are using a GHC that was configured with
                    @--with-system-libffi@, however, you will need to disable
                    this option and link against the system's version of
                    @libffi@ instead.
