synopsis:            prettier function composition by (°)
description:         Yes, I am afraid it is completely trivial and syntactic.
                     However, the use of '.' is quite overloaded, so that e.g.
                     character search becomes a problem. Pretty looking & 
                     generally available at the keyboard, '°' solves this.
                     Possibly the most simple Hackage package ever. :-P
