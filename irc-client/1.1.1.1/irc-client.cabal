description:
  An IRC client library built atop
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/irc-conduit irc-conduit>. Why
  another IRC client library, you cry? I didn't really find one that
  did what I wanted (specifically, handle connecting to servers and
  calling event handlers, possibly with TLS), but which didn't
  implement almost a full IRC bot for you. That takes out all the fun!
  .
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/irc-conduit irc-conduit> and
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/irc-ctcp irc-ctcp> are my
  solution to the first part of that, this is my solution to the
  latter. It's a simple IRC client library that does the basics for
  you, but isn't an all-singing, all-dancing, fully-featured IRC
  /application/. It is a merely a simple library.
