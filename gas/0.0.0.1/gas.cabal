synopsis: Limit how many steps a program may take.
description:
    Programs constructed using free applicatives or free monads may be analyzed
    statically or dynamically (respectively). This package uses such analysis
    to limit the number of steps the program may take. This is useful for EDSLs
    with untrusted input, or in general when you want to guarantee termination
    by cutting off a program.
    .
    Note that this package does not avoid infinite loops in bottom values. Use
    the "System.Timeout" module for that instead.
