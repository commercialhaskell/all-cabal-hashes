Synopsis:         Sort RPM packages in dependency order
Description:
  The rpmbuild-order tool sorts source RPM packages by build dependencies,
  so that they can be built in a correct order. It does this by reading RPM
  package spec files and then topologically sorts them according to their
  build dependencies. The code evolved from cabal-sort by Henning Thielemann.
  It can also order the dependencies or reverse depends of one or more packages
  among the packages checked out in neighboring directories (which can be
  useful to see what packages are affected when a low-level package changes).
  It also has support for setting RPM options for bcond etc,
  which can affect dependencies. It can also output dependency graphs.

  Since version 0.4, a library API is also provided.
