synopsis:            Order statistic trees based on weight-balanced trees
description:         This repository contains an implementation of order statistic tree in Haskell programming language.
                     I could not find an order statistic tree at Hackage, so I have to develop one.
                     .
                     This implementation uses weight-balanced trees which are desribed in
                     .

                     .
                     Also some code is based on containers package.
                     .
                     Implementation of order statistic tree is described in
                     .

                     .
                     I tried to make this tree as fast as possible. The results on my i7-4790 with 16Gb RAM are following:
                     .
                     - OSTree was created from 1.000.000 random numbers in 2.087 ± 0.021 s (e.g. for Data.Map.Strict - 1.977 ± 0.016 s);
                     - deletion from OSTree with 1.000.000 random numbers was made in 13.94 ± 0.93 ms;
                     - lookup from OSTree with 1.000.000 random numbers was made in 208.2 ± 3.48 ns;
                     - selection from OSTree with 1.000.000 random numbers was made in 92.72 ± 1.91 ns;
                     - full testing protocol can be found in result-bench.txt.
