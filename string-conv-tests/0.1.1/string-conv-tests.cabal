synopsis:            Tests for the string-conv library
description:         These are in a separate project not only to keep
                     dependencies low when the string-conv library is included
                     in a project but also because these property tests use
                     `quickcheck-instances` which defines many orphan
                     instances. Never a good idea to force instances like this
                     on other projects.
